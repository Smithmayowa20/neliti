<h1 style="text-align:center;">Neliti Similar Research Papers Reccomender Project<br> Test On 1000 records</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Possible Improvements On Current Execution</h2>
<p> Improvement include increasing the no of times the database list is randomized and keeping track of the top 10 samllest distance through all the randomizing events</p>
<p> Adding a text classification model that classifies each entry into specific academic categories(about 100 or so) and then perfoming the wmd calculation between entries of similar categories</p>
<p> Predicting the categories of each new entry and recalculating the wmd of just that category, to cut back on unnecessary calculations </p>
<p> Utilize Indonesian and English Fasttext models to eliminate current reliance on text translation, and to also acquire vectors for even mispelled words</p>

Indonesia is one of the most populous in the worlds with 237.6 million people in 2010, where 76.93 % of povertyareconcentratedin Java(55.33%) andSumatra(21.6%). This paper attempted to create profiling poverty of 151 residences and cities in Sumatera. The poverty characteristics included in the profiling are:levelof education, manpower distribution, expenditures per capita, health, housing facilities, and government's poverty eradication programs. Data resources are from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS). The data were analyzed by principle component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Data Analysis.Factor analysis produced as many as 32 variables as the main components, adequate for further analysis as 'key factors' for social economic characteristic profile of residences and cities in Sumatera.  These main components demonstrated the adequate values of KMO, MSA, and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity. Following the result from Factor Analysis to obtain the important factors of poverty, the method of hierarchical cluster analysis was, further, used to classify the profiles of 108 residences and cities in Sumatera. The results of cluster analysis with 5interesting clusters of poverty profile of socio-economic indicators show that Cluster 1 comprises of 7 residences with similar characteristic of level of educationand manpower distribution. Cluster 2 includes 9 residences with similar level of education and expenditures per capita. Cluster 3 consists of 36 residences and 2 cities with similar manpower distribution and expenditures per capita patterns. Cluster 4 comprises of 23 residences and 3 cities showing its own distinct characteristics in their similarity patterns of expenditures per capita and housing facilities. Then, the cluster 5 consists of 2 residences and 27 cities showing the similar patterns in level of education and housing facilities.",

In this research, the capital structure is represented by three indicators: Debt Ratio, Debt Equity Ratio, and Long Term Debt to Equity. Profitability is examined by Return on Asset, Return on Equity and Net Profit Margin, while firm value is proxy by Book Value, Price to Book Value, and Closing Price. Using Partial Least Square Method, this study finds that all indicators are useful to measure the latent variables. While in the analysis of structural model or inner model, the result supports Hypothesis 1 that capital structure has negatively significant influence on firm value. The higher the debts that firms employed, the lower its values. This study also supports Hypothesis 2 that capital structure influences the profitability significantly. This indicates that firms with high capital structures will have a decrease in profit. The result of the research also supports Hypothesis 3 that profitability influences the firm values positively. It means that higher profitability of a firm will result in a higher firm value.",

Keywords: Brand Awareness, Brand Association, Perceived Quality, Brand Loyalty and Brand EquityAbstrtak Kondisi persaingan merek provider operator telepon seluler yang semakin ketat, mendorong konsumen untuk melakukan pembelian terhadap merek yang mampu memberikan nilai lebih disbanding merek lainnya. Kekuatan suatu merek di pasar dipengaruhi oleh ekuitas merek yang terdapat pada merek tersebut. Ekuitas merek dianggap sebagai cerminan atas nilai tambah yang dimiliki suatu merek. Pembentukan ekuitas merek dipengaruhi oleh dimensi-dimensi pembentuknya, seperti kesadaran merek, asosiasi merek, persepsi kualitas, dan loyalitas merek.  Konsumen akan mampu mengingat suatu merek, jika merek tersebut mampu memberikan nilai lebih kepadanya, sehingga persepsi akan kualitas yang diberikan merek tersebut semakin lama semakin kuat terbentuk seiring dengan bertambahnya pengalaman konsumen, serta kepuasaan yang dirasakan terhadap merek tersebut yang akhirnya membuat konsumen tersebut loyal pada merek tersebut. Hal tersebut sejalan dengan tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui dan menjelaskan pengaruh secara bersama-sama dan sendiri-sendiri dari variable Brand Awareness, Brand Association, Perceived Quality dan Brand Loyalty terhadap Brand Equity. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa variable-variabel bebas meliputi Brand Awareness, Brand Association, Perceived Quality, Brand loyalty secara bersama-sama atau sendiri-sendiri mempunyai pengaruh yang signifikan terhadad Brand Equity.",

The independent variable in this study is the current ratio, debt to equity ratio, and total asset turnover, while the dependent variable is the return on investment and return on equity. The methods use descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression. Based on the results of a descriptive analysis of a three-year study period variable current ratio indicates the ideal result that the working capital available in an amount sufficient to fund the company's activities. Variable debt to equity ratio shows safe results that the composition of the loan capital that is not too large compared to the equity, the total asset turnover variables showed good activity results which generated net sales greater than assets issued by the company, and the variable return on investment and return on equity showed a further increase, thus indicating the ability of the company resulting in better profits. Based on multiple linear regression analysis, it can be concluded that there are significant simultaneously and partially between liquidity ratio, leverage ratio and activities ratio against the company's financial performance.",

The X-Rays Diffractometer (XRD) investigation on their crystals structure has shown that the samples resulted through this technique are almost as homogenously single crystals. Observation using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique on their surfaces has shown that the films have a constant thickness around 0.7mm and smooth surfaces. Further investigation on their magnetic behavior results in magnetic hysteresis at the coercive field around 80-150 Oe, with the largest remanent magnetization about 150-250 emu/cm3.",

Based on the results of t-test can be seen that the variable product, price, location, and promotion significantly influence purchasing decisions. T-test results also showed that the location of the variable t has a value and greatest beta coefficient. So the location variables most strongly influence compared to other variables the variable location has a dominant influence on the purchase decision structure. Adjusted R Square value in this study was 0.560. This indicates that approximately 56% of purchase decisions can be explained by the four independent variables, namely Product, Price, Location, Promotion.

In connection with this case, it will be explained regarding liability issues of a child (swadharama). If someone gets inheritance but he has changed his religion then how does the inheritance status. The issue of this research is why the status of land ownership inheritance can be turned into Pelaba Pura land in Balinese folks costumary law and how does the process of inheritance land ownership transfer into a Pelaba Pura land in Balinese folks customary law in traditional village of canggu.\nType of research used was empirical legal research conducted in the village of Canggu. It was a descriptive study. This study used primary and secondary data sources. Data collection techniques in this research were observation, interview and document study. Data processing and analysis techniques used in this study generally consisted of three stages of data analysis: data reduction, data display, and data verification stage.\nResults of the study on the considered problem was that the status of inheritance land ownership can be turned into Pelaba Pura land in in Balinese folks costumary law because of religion change eliminates a person's status as a heir. Only descendants with Kapurusa status were deemed capable of taking care and continuing family's Swadharma (responsibility), both in relation to parahyangan (Hindu's belief), pawongan (Hindus), and palemahan (preservation of the natural environment in accordance with the Hindu's belief). Thus it is the same as the person who left the family responsibilities (ninggal kedaton), and are therefore considered not entitled to inheritance in families. The ownership process of inheritance land that become Pelaba Pura land in customary law community of Canggu Bali. A single heir who has switched religions can no longer be regarded as an heir. Therefore disputed inheritance from the past until now has been dominated by Canggu custom banjar as pengemong and pengempon Khayangan temples of Canggu custom banjar hereditary. In this case the land is used as Pelaba Pura land which proposed sporadically. Existence of land belonging to the temple already has a legal basis, namely by the presence of Government Regulation No. 38 of 1963 On Legal institution to Have Properties of Land which was reaffirmed by the Decree of Home Affairs Ministry of Indonesia SK / 556 / DJA / 1986 on the appointment of Temple As a Religious Legal Entity That Can Have Reserved Land Rights.",

The plurality of religion and belief is no longer understood as a potential riot, but be a potential to be invited to jointly implement the teachings for the sake of humanity. All religions should claim peace and human safety. In this context, education has an important role to foster self-scratch, so not only can receive others, but also able to work with different beliefs or religion. This means that education should enable the growth of the brotherhood in unity, so as to jointly build a new world that is more meaningful for all of humanity. So that, design education should accommodate pluralist and tolerant. Attitude required teachers of religion that is tolerant and pluralist.",

Compatibility of C. albidus and  C. terreus  was tested through bio-assay  against Lasiodiplodia theobromae on detached banana fruit  and Alternaria solani on detached tomato leaves.  Compatibility was indicated by no reduction of antagonistic activity.  Benomyl-resistant mutant of C. albidus  and cycloheximide-resistant mutant of  C. terreus were mixed with sterilized tapioca, talc and kaolin  to get initial yeasts density of  8.5 log cfu/g and water content of 15%,  then  packed by plastic bag and stored under room temperature. Survival of formulated yeasts was assessed monthly by plating on PDA medium containing 150 ppm cycloheximide for C. terreus, and 150 ppm benomyl for C. albidus.  Yeasts population was expressed in log cfu/g materials.  To determine effect of carrier materials on antagonistic activity, bio-assay of formulated yeasts against pathogens was conducted after 3 months storage. Tested additives i.e. CaCl2, pure chitin and crab shell powder were added into suspension of C. albidus and C. terreus to get concentration of 1.25%,  0.5 %  and 0. 1% (w/v). Sterilized aquadest and yeasts without additives was used as control. Then  the treatments was examined the antagonistic activity through  bio-asaay  on detached banana fruits and tomato leaves. Appropriate additive(s) was determined by its ability to increase antagonistic activity of yeasts. Storability and antagonistic activity of  C. albidus dan C. terreus  in the mixture of best carrier and additive were examined.  C. terreus  was compatible to C. albidus. The best carrier materials supporting highest survival of C. terreus was tapioca and talc, those supported survival for four months storage.  Talc was best carrier material for C. albidus formulation by maintaining its survival for five months storage. Additives which able to increase antagonistic activity of C. terreus were CaCl2  0.1 % , pure chitin  0.1 %  and crab shell powder  0.5%.  Additives providing best increase of antagonistic activity of C. albidus were CaCl2 0.5%, pure chitin  1.25 %  and crab shell 1.25%.  Supplementation of chitin and crab shell, both at the rate of 1.25% into talc-base powder formulation  increased  survival of both yeasts at one months storage, however no significant effect subsequently.",

Looks is the first impression in socializing with other people, with an understanding of color and aesthetic intuition of good matching, will create an attractive and not-boring appearance. In addition to improving mood, good cloth matching can also help a person to appear more attractive. Of course, such expertise cannot be obtained in a short time, it takes some extra knowledge in addition to understanding harmonious color combinations theory in general. We must consider other factors such as how to recognize skin color that will sustain the intensity of the color selection for our appearance. Hopefully, with this writing, the reader can see and learn a fashion matching appearance better.",

From the results of research using normative law research method can be concluded, that: There has been an increase in the number of cases from 655 cases PHPU (Pilleg 2009) to 902 cases (Pilleg 2014). In the case judging by the number pesertapemilunya, Pilleg 2009 far more than 2014 Pilleg 2009 diikutioleh 11 219 candidates DPR and DPD candidates 1116, whereas in 2014 only Pilleg 6607 followed by the House of Representatives candidates and 945 candidates DPD. Increase in cases is due to the procedural law of the Court has broadened the legal standing of the applicant which is not only political parties and individual candidates for the DPD, also individual candidates DPR and DPRD both provincial and district / city. As a result in 2014 Pilleg add some 118 cases of individual petition. Dissatisfaction with the process, namely the emergence of many alleged violations. Dissatisfaction of this process does not necessarily indicate poor quality of recall of 902 cases filed, only 22 cases were granted the 2,4persen. During the filing of the petition, the Constitutional Court issued a different release related to the number of cases received. The case number was changed from every stage of acceptance of the case. The difference is due to differences in the number of policies in force between the constitution and the general secretary of the Constitutional Court judges who then gave Ruan gbagi pemoho nuntuk apply for passing of the deadline 3x24 hours. As a result, some of the petition must be declared not accepted due to the overdue filing. Should the Court can refuse the request during the registration process is closed, so do not give up hope palsu.Pengaturan Dispute Settlement Legislative Election Results In the Constitutional Court More Effective Into his future is together Election Commission (KPU), Election Supervisory Body (Bawaslu ) to establish a dispute resolution mechanisms and electoral complaints within the electoral system in Indonesia.Such mechanisms necessary to protect the rights of citizens and help determine whether the election is really a true reflection of the will of its citizens. so that the elections can be credible, it is important for voters and election contestants to have access to the electoral resolution mechanism that is independent, fair, accessible and effective. However, in order to strengthen the dispute resolution structures and make it more user-friendly (easy to use) and effective, Indonesia needs to take some important steps before the national elections going forward with ratification of the Electoral Law timely by the House of Representatives (DPR), Bawaslu and Supervisory Committee's mandate is to mediate in order to ease the burden sengekat Commission and allow more cases to be processed by shorter.",

Religion is understood as rescue individuals and not as a social blessing together, as if God is not present in social problems despite his name was mentioned everywhere, religion has become a stagnant spiritual message, symbolic expression without meaning. Researchers and social commentator gives his analysis that this phenomenon as the impact of modernity that led to the crisis of modern man's spiritual so that they no longer know who he is, and the meaning of life. It can be said that all the missions of the core teachings of Islam on the doctrine of monotheism, morality and the law would basically lead to the moral education. That is why so it is said to have a close relationship and a depth between Islam and science of the soul, when we examine carefully that Sufism is part of moral education, in the process sufism are doing things that are related to moral education leads to character desired by al-Qur`an to get to be perfect man as the caliph as well as Abdullah.",

This research uses the entire population of companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange 2010-2012 period with 12 samples were obtained through purposive sampling. This research used multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed capital structure (leverage) has significant influence on dividend policy.

The data that were obtained from research results were analyze statistically by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The result of ANOVA further were tested using Duncan's multiple range test 5% significant level. The results of this research show that the application of neem until 0,75g/column dosage is not effective in decreasing nitrogen leaching on peat soil. The application of nitrogen on peat soil increases ammonium on leachate water on fourth week, but not on second and sixth week, while, on nitrat of leachate is significantly different compare to without application of nitrogen. The application of neem until 0,75g/column dosage and nitrogen 3,75g/column does not increase the growth of plant.",

        "description": "Due to its great role which is now globalizing, to be able to communicate in English well is a dream of all people over the world, including Indonesians. However, it is not easy for non-English people to learn the language, especially for those whose native language is so greatly different in terms of the pronunciation, spelling, and grammatical features. For Indonesian people, generally, English is not easy to learn that efforts to facilitate he learners' English language acquisition have been made from time to time for example by changing or evaluating the English Curriculum, the teaching methods, etc. Until now, there has not been a single method or technique known to be truly effective and efficient to use in teaching the language to the Indonesian students. This article presents some views which need considering for the success of the learning of English in Indonesia. That intrinsic learning motivation which results from self-awareness of the English language great role in everyone's study or career is advisable to be possessed by the learners is one main factor for their good success in learning the language. Therefore, it should be socialized to the children as early as possible. In learning the English words, the teacher should familiarize the students with how every word is used in context, not in isolation as words actually do not carry clear meanings in isolation. The meaning of a word is determined by its context, so it should be contextually studied. The aspects of grammar to he dealt with also should be based on the dominant grammatical mistakes in the sentences made by the learners so as to arouse their curiosity and interest in acquiring the language. The outdated thinking that one who is using English at public places is regarded as showing off or conceited, and the language should be used only in the classroom or at certain occasions, should be eradicated now since it hampers language acquisition.",

The universe together with all its richness and vitality is the work and art of God, that is, of the Creator. We are God's vicegerents on the earth; it has been given us in trust. Just as we are not the lords of nature and the world, so the world is not our property which we can dispose of as we wish or as we are able. Nature was created by God and it belongs to God.

The first is an industry using agricultural products as its main input material, thus, agro-industrial studies emphasize the food processing management within agro-based enterprises that process mainly agricultural products. The second relates to a development stage, placing agro-industry between agricultural and industrial development where it is often used for sustainable agricultural development, sustainable agro-industrial development, and sustainable development.In order to gain maximum outcome effectively and efficiently, the implementation of the above concepts is named \u2018Integrated Agro-industry System' (IAS), i.e. the integration of the function and role of agro-industry components for making better outcome in the relatively long period. IAS is expected to contribute more significantly in (a) enhancing income and profitability for producers or processors and ultimately increasing the welfare of society and (b) strengthening national economy. Furthermore, IAS shall consider the following unfinished agendas, i.e. (a) rising agricultural population and the declining role of agriculture; (b) rising of urban drift of rural workers may affect the agro/rural industries; (c) if point (b) happened then accelerating growth of the agro-industrial sector will face lack of un-trained personnel; (d) growing the negative impacts of using natural and agricultural resources for industry; and (e) shrinking subsistence farming versus increased cash cropping, coinciding with the depletion of forests, soil and a rise in plant and animal diseases.",

It makes the transport process of residential waste to temprorary landfill site (TPS) that has been existed, less efficient. Transporting waste process with garbage cart is depended on the manpower, while with the garbage truck, the vehicle's width and the use of fossil fuels are the weaknesses. Thus, the design concept of a waste transport vehicle using electric motor as driving source is made which has the same payload capacity as a garbage cart in general. Garbage payload along with the main components must be strongly supported by the vehicle frame, which incidentally serves as the support vehicle. In this study, discussed the optimization of electric waste transport vehicle with the help of 3-dimensional CAD modelling, then simulated with static loading to obtain the results of the stress, displacement with the maximum value and location, and can assign the payload distribution position. With variable of the beam profile shape and its thickness, then obtained the optimal order forms, which frame weighs as light as possible but still robust in supporting given loads, which is frame with a cylindrical hollow profile with diameter of 60.3 mm and thickness of 4 mm .",

Method: NPWT was made by using digital breast pump. Wounds were divided into two groups; wound-treated by NPWT (experimental group) and wound-untreated by NPWT (control). The negative pressure used for this study was 85 mmHg. Rats were sacrifi ced on day 7, and wound samples and surrounding skin were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosyn. Infl ammation, intensity of necrotic tissue, and wound closure were observed. Result: The device could deliver a negative pressure at a range of 85\u2013140 mmHg. Wound size in the experimental group was smaller than in control group. Infl ammation was also less in the experimental group than control group. Discussion: The modifi cation of breast pump could be used as a negative pressure therapy for wounds, and has effect on reducing infl ammation and necrotic tissue.

In fact, it is hardly to define what Indonesian politeness is and how it works due to the huge diversity featuired by the 583 ethnic languages and dialects existed in the country. Other important considerations are the large number of  communities of practice existed in the society.

This condition is suspected to have something to do with the lack of optimal decision-making, delegation of authority, supervision, and communication has not been well overnight. This research applies qualitative research method with informant that set as many as 6 people. After the data collected the analysis is done by applying data analysis techniques namely, data reduction, data presentation, and data verification or conclusion.The research shows that (1) In leadership of Camat to improve the performance of Civil State Apparatus apparatus is one of indicator that decision making has not run as expected of Civil State Apparatus in District of Galela Barat. This is because the decision making which is often done by the Camat is not involving the participation of the staff, so there are employees who feel the need for involvement in decision making. (2) Leadership indicators Camat in improving job performance Civil Service Apparatus one of them is the delegation of authority. As per the result of research that indicator have not run well. Due to the reality, there is still less Camat's confidence in subordinates / employees, so that in delegation of authority more in submitted to the Secretary of the Camat in comparison with other employees. (3) One indicator of leadership of Camat that needs to be done is supervision on employee performance. According to the results of the research that the supervisory system Camat on employee performance has not gone well, because seen from the fact that there are still employees who are not disciplined in performing duties as a public servant. (4) As the result of research indicate that communication aspect has been running well, be it communication vertically (Up-Down) or horizontally (Interview).Based on the conclusion above, the researcher suggests that the Camat leadership needs to improve in terms of decision making, delegation of authority, supervision and communication. It is expected that the Camat as the leader to involve the participation of the State Civil Apparatus in the subdistrict of Galela Barat, the delegation of the authority of the Subdistrict Head should see the educational background of the officer who will assume the position temporarily, in order to be able to carry out the tasks according to the instruction of the Camat based on the stated objectives. (3) The sub-district head as the representative of the district government in the kecamatan should further improve the supervisory function on ASN performance. Because in Government Regulation No. 46 of 2011 on the assessment of the performance of civil servants, that one indicator of employee performance is seen from the level of self-discipline employees. By that, the Camat is expected to further tighten supervision in terms of employee discipline in performing duties as a public servant. (4) Communication between leaders and employees can be done better, in order to provide information relating to the duties and functions of each employee in West Galela District.",

Then, on 1980's non-party Moslem intellectual again point out the human rights by referencing to the Syatibi concept about \"maqashid al syari 'ah\" but still basis of \"al istikhlaf\" anf \"taklif\" concept. In fact, identity conflict among the global life during 3decades later caused the making of several laws and declaration of human rights in Islam from some sides, whether individual, group, institute or even state. All pointed out the unity and the perfection of Islamic teaching.",

It is caused by many factors, such as geographicallocation, cost, number of health personnel and conditionof health care facilities, such as health centers and theirnetworks which are not accessible to the public. Several attemptshave been made, for example, by improving the statusof sub-health centers to be health centers, health centers tobe treatment centers, assinging health workers both medicaland paramedical, improving health financing and making budgetpolicies. However, its implementation has not been maximal.In accordance with the above background, it would requirea study on the role of local government policy in improvingthe referral system which is useful to know the problemsin the field, so that in the future a variety of improvement canbe done.Objective: To determine the referral system in the islandsarea of Linga District.Methods: This was a case-study research. The researchsubjects were head of health centers / health center doctors,nurses/midwife assistants, ambulance drivers/sea ambulancedrivers, patient families, community figures, jamkesmas/Jamkesda managers, head of health care section/head ofhealth office, director of local hospital/mobile hospital and emergencyroom nurses. The variables in this study were independentvariable (referral system) and dependent variable (ambulanceservice). The research location was in Linga Districtof Kepualauan Riau Province.Results: The results showed that policy efforts of the LingaGovernment District in improving the referral system had existed.The existing financing policy had encompassed twoaspects both from the demand side (medical expenses) andfrom the supply side (a system that supported health care).The process of referral from primary care to advanced serviceshad been going well although there was still lack as theunavailability and completeness of services. Most of the healthworkers had received training; there were also specialist doctors(in collaboration with the faculty of medicine), but networkingin the referral process was done partially and notintegrated.Conclusion: The health referral system in Linga District hadrun pretty well, but did not fully involve community participationin an integrated service system. The local government in thiscase Linga District Health Office needs to revitalize as well asaccelerate the development of Desa Siaga (alert villages) readinessto increase community participation in the developmentof a referral system.Keywords: policy, referral systems, islands, ambulance service",

As most known, the logical positivism has influenced the natural science acceleration. Social and humanity sciences, including religion studies, have been dominated by physicalism of natural science methods which was developed on logical positivism ideas. Carnap's main works concerned on language and logics, semantics, and syntax. On logical positivism, Carnap's thought could be looked at in three sections: verification and confirmation, elimination of metaphysics, and imified of science (scientism). Its implication for religious living is the problem of meaning the religion texts according to logical positivism propositions, which be concluded that the propositions/texts of religion teaching have not meaning if they could be not verified or obeserved.",

The research was conducted through adsorption process using bentonite adsorbent which was initially physically activated to open external porosity, so that the ammonia absorption became bigger. The adsorption process was conducted in jar test by using lab scale under the following process and treatment condition: determine the stirring used from 100-200rpm, adsorbent mass 10-40 gram/200 ml, heating temperature 100-1400C. The results of the research showed that the percentage of the highest ammonia concentration reduction in solution waste was 82,05% which was obtained in bentonite activation temperature 1200C, absorbent mass 38 g/200 ml, stirring in 100 rpm and contact time in 60 minutes.",

The aim of these sudden programs is creating more realistic and just situation. However, the situations are getting worse as ethnic cleansing, misused of power, and separatist movements are becoming daily realities. This is due to the fact that since the fifties the Indonesian central government gradually pays little attention to the education and health programs. Moreover, the central government has no serious attempts to create the real middle class and private sectors in addition to carrying the rule of the law. Through this limited available space, this article tries to highlight the first core for the successful autonomy and decentralization by providing good education, based upon science and revelation, for the Indonesians as a whole, especially for the young generation.",

Culture of civilized life can not be realized in the concrete life just by relying on faith alone, but also need the willingness of all parties, including state officials, to subjugate himself under the control of the values and norms that exist and run it with full sincerity.",

Based on qualitative method, I propose that the dynamic domination of religious values will construct the public interest and it tend to navigate the mass media performance as well as their consumer's expectations, but it will raise the unfinished dilemma in defining and searching of the best formula of mass media performance and their public responsibilities.",

        "description": "We compared seedling emergence and soil seed bank composition under an Acacia mangium plantation and an adjacent tropical heath forest in the Andulau Forest Reserve, Brunei Darussalam. Soil samples were collected from ten 20 x 20 m plots set up in three contrasting habitats: the Acacia plantation, the adjacent heath forest, and the transition zone in-between. Soil samples were subjected to smoke and heat treatments, following which seedling emergence was observed daily over a 12-week period. In a parallel investigation, variations in species richness, seed density and seed viability of the soil seed banks of the ten plots were investigated. Seedling emergence was significantly highest in the plantation and lowest in the heath forest plots respectively. However, no significant differences among treatments, and no significant treatment-habitat interactions were detected. Species richness, seed density and seed viability in the plantation plots were significantly lower than the transition zone and intact heath forest plots. A. mangium seeds were not recorded in the heath forest soil seed banks but were detected in the plantation and transition zone plots. Lower native plant species richness, seed density and viability in the A. mangium plantation could imply higher regeneration potential for the heath forest habitat if severe habitat destruction was to occur in this forest reserve. We suggest that proper plantation management practices and close monitoring of soil seed banks are the best mechanisms that could be adopted to minimize the gradual spread of invasive Acacias into natural tropical heath forests of Borneo.",

        "description": "Flood that occurred in Jakarta is not only influenced by rainfall, urban planning system and drainage alone, but also may be involved land subsidence (LS). LS is possible in because Jakarta stands on top of layers of sediments and the presence of ground water consumption in very large quantities. In this research, the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data was processed to determine the level of LS in Jakarta area and its relation to flood potential area. Differential interferometry method (DInSAR) was performed on two PALSAR data with different acquisition years, i.e. 2007 and 2008, respectively. DInSAR processing generated images containing information that can be converted into LS. To find the elevation changing area, log ratio algorithm was applied to those images as the additional analysis. The log ratio image is superimposed on the DInSAR result andJakarta inundation map of 2009, to acquire the relationship between LS and the flood and flood vulnerability map of Jakarta based on LS. It is found that lands on the flooded area of 10.57 cm on the average, with a minimum and maximum of 5.25 cm and 22.5 cm, respectively. The greater the value of LS, inundation area also tend to widen, except in a few areas that have special conditions, such as reservoirs, river flow solution, water pump system and sluices. Accuracy of DInSAR result image is quite high, with the difference of 0.03 cm (0.18%) to 0.55 cm (3.37%) as compared to those from GPS measurements. These results can be recommended to the local government of Jakarta to minimize the potential risk of flood, as well as the subject of city planning for the future.",

They are extensively grown in backyards, homegardens, intercropped with short term crops and also in agroforestry system. Potential role of bananas to absorb and store Carbon related to climate change mitigation is rarely studied. An inventory of biomass and C-stock estimation on banana accessions has been conducted in Musa germplasm plots - Purwodadi Botanic Garden, Pasuruan. 42individual banana accessions has been estimated its biomass and C-stock comprises of 5 wild types and 37 cultivars. Biomass estimated using non-destructive method ie. allometric equation for banana by measuring its mature stage pseudostem diameter at breast height (dbh).  C-stockwas estimated by crossing its biomass to averaged value of banana C-stock 0,46.The results showed that the biomass and C-stock estimation level were in positive correlations with its plants pseudostem dbH.

This research was conducted to confirm the occurrence of somaclonal variation during micropropagation, to know the level of variation in three different populations, to detect and to reduce the somaclonal variation of pineapple clone Simadu. The first population was the acclimatized plants and plantlets of four-year old cultures. The second population was the plantlets yielded from three kinds of regeneration methods (direct organogenesis, indirect organogenesis, somatic embryogenesis) derived from the normal phenotype shoots selected from the first population. The third population was the new in vitro cultures regenerated by shoot proliferation and direct organogenesis methods. RAPD analysis by using 10 primers was performed to confirm genetic variation. The result showed that the phenotypic variation occurred in the four year-old pineapple plants and plantlets were due to genetic variation. This research has proved that the long-period of cultures is the main contributor of somaclonal variation, while the regeneration method and plant growth regulator could also induce genetic variation. The new cultures showed higher level of similarity. Therefore, it needs a correct strategy to apply micropropagation method.",

        "description": "Net Primary Production, NPP, is one of the most important variables characterizing the performance of an ecosystem. It is the difference between the total carbon uptake from the air through photosynthesis and the carbon loss due to respiration by living plants. However, field measurements of NPP are time-consuming and expensive. Current techniques are therefore not useful for obtaining NPP estimates over large areas. By combining the remote sensing and GIS technology and modelling, we can estimate NPP of a large ecosystem with a little ease. This paper discusses the use of a process based physiological sunshade canopy models in estimating NPP of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP). The discussion includes on how to parameterize the models and how to scale up from leaf to the canopy. The version documented in this manuscript is called NetPro Model, whicha potential NPP model where water effect is not included yet. The model integrates CIS and the use of Remote Sensing, and written in Visual Basic 6.0 programming language and Map Objects 2.1. NetPro has the capability of estimating NPP of Cs vegetation under present environmental condition and under future scenarios (increasing [CO2], increasing temperature and increasing or decreasing leaf nitrogen level). Based on site-measured parameterisation of VaM* (Photosynthetic capacity), /JjRespiration) and leaf nitrogen ONi), the model was run under increasing CO2 level and temperature and varied leaf nitrogen. The output of the semi-mechanistic modelling is radiation use efficiency (?). Analysis of remote sensing data give Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and related Leaf Area Index (LAI) and traction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (/M>AK). Climate data are obtained from 12 meteorological stations around die parks, which includes global radiations, minimum and maximum temperature. CO2 absorbed by vegetation (Gross Primary Production, GPP) is then calculated using the above variables and parameters with the following equation:estimating NPP, while ecosystem respiration is set as a function of temperature for estimating NEE. Under present condition, the net absorption of CO> by the vegetation of Lore Lindu National Park (NPP) is 1330.31 gCm\"2year\"' and at double CO2 and temperature increased of 3.5 \"C, it increased by 23 %, reaching 1638.80 gCm'2 year'1.",

        "description": "The North Papua waters as one of the important fishing grounds in the world contribute approximately 75% of world production of pelagic tunas. These fishing grounds are still determined by hunting method. This method is time consuming and costly. However, in many areas determination of fishing ground using satellited data lias been applied by detecting the important oceanographic parameter of the presence of fish schooling such as, sea surface temperature and chlorophyl. Mostly these parameters are used integratedly. The aim of this study is to assess the important oceanographic parameters detected from multi-sensor satellites (NOAA/AVHRR, Seawifs and Topex Poisedon) for determining fishing ground of pelagic tunas in the North Papua waters at east season. The parameters include Sea Surface Temperature (STT), chlorophyl-a and currents. The availability of data from optic sensor (Seawifs: chl-a and AVHRR: Thermal) is limited by the presence of cloud cover. In that case, Topex Poseidon satellite data can be used to provide the currents data. The integration of data from multi-sensors increases the availability of the oceanographic parameters for prediction of the potential fishing zones in the study area.",

One game that requires such AI is a turn-based strategy game. To be able to create an interesting and challenging AI for the player, it is require equally strong and dynamic AI.To create such AI, ID3 and Influence Map will be used as the base of the AI used in turn-based strategy game. Applications made include ID3 training software and Influence Map class inside the game that will be used. ID3 System is made to have the ability to process continuous data.The results showed that the ability to create a decision tree by ID3 is greatly influenced by the training data used. The results also showed that the propagation method used for the Influence Map system can be set to suit the requirements in the game.",

The results showed that the VAM inoculation increased  sunflower  yield  (14%),  total  biomass  (16%),  oil  content  (3.1%)  and  P  uptake  (30.5%)  over uninoculated  control.  The  percent  root  colonization  and  chlamydo-spore  count  decreased with  increasing  P levels. The total biomass production, seed yield and P uptake of mycorrhizal plants at 38 kg P2O5 ha-1 more than the non-mycorrhizal plants at 75 kg P2O5 ha-1. The biomass and seed yield of mycorrhizal plants at same P level were more than the non-mycorrhizal plants. Mycorrhizal plants of Morden at 38 kg P2O5 ha-1 and MSFH-8 at 56 kg P2O5 ha-1 produced higher seed yield, oil content and total biomass than non-mycorrhizal plants supplied with 75 kg P2O5 ha-1.  The results indicated that, VA-mycorrhizal inoculation helps in saving 25 and 50 percent of recommended dose of phosphatic  fertilizer (75 kg P2O5 ha-1) in MSFH-8 (single cross hybrid) and Morden (open pollinated variety), respectively.",

A thriving global workplace requires effective communication skill across cultures in this era of globalization and mass migration. Under the tutelage of such backdrop, this article addresses the terrain of adopting intercultural awareness in EFL classroom teaching/learning and aims at linking culture with language in pursuit of excellence in borderless effective communication. The study, in other words, investigated the linguistic aspects that could be affected by certain cultural dimensions (e.g., beliefs, traditions, taboo words, habits, and norms, religion, social factors, etc.) in intercultural communication. This paper uses a questionnaire device to receive some university teachers' self-reported feedback. This article maintains qualitative and quantitative research methodology. The analytical research result shows that in teaching English, it is necessary to incorporate and develop aspects of cross-cultural awareness as a part of course curriculum to immerse students in effective intercultural communicative competence (ICC).",

Indonesia is one of leading country of papaya production after India and Brazil. The Centre of Tropical Fruits Study (PKBT) at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), Indonesia, has started a long term breeding program since 2003 in order improving the quality of local papayas. Fruit exports are being targeted at more specialized consumers, either those seeking products raised in more environmentally and health-conscious ways or those who are prepared to pay a significant for outstanding flavour. Flavour continues to be the predominant quality characteristic important for a successful International marketing. To understand the biosynthesis pathways are becoming more important for the flavour industry in recent years, as this could aid in the production of the flavour volatiles in the same manner as the natural biosynthesis. It is also necessary to understand the aroma active compounds and their changes during processing because unexpected changes in aroma may cause a product unmarketable even if the other quality factors are acceptable. Understanding the changes of aroma active compounds in the papaya fruit, such as loss of desirable flavour and development of off-flavour during processing will be very helpful for determining proper processing condition. The flavour composition of papaya fruit is reviewed in this paper. This paper will also overview of important publications regarding  the characteristic features of the biology of the fruits, consumption worldwide, commercial application in food processing, though the review of biogenesis of volatiles still be the main focus.",

Unfortunately, the area is invaded by Merremia peltata which occupied  about  7 000 ha. The aims of this study was to determine the ecological impacts of  M. peltata on plant biodiversity at BBSNP. Three locations were selected for vegetation analysis and M.peltata invasion assessment on the vegetation composition in BBSNP, i.e. the primary forest representing undisturbed area, secondary forest representing burned area, and invaded forest representing forest invaded by M. peltata. Three line transects  were constructed at each locations along1 km, and  the nested sampling plots were constructed every 100 m with the following quadrants : 20 m x 20 m for trees, 10 m  x 10 m for poles, 5 m  x 5 m for sapling, and 2 m x 2 m for seedling. The data collected were invasions of M. peltata, trees species, and diameter of the trees.  Invaded forest has lower diversity index (1.90)  than the other two. This caused by the invasion of M. peltata as the percentage of coverage in the invaded forest reached 44% compared to secondary and the primary forest which were  27.11% and 1.00%. It is evidenced by the correlation between the percentage of coverage M. peltata and diversity index (-0.988).",

We studied the nutrient concentration (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and phytomass of aboveground (living and non living parts) and belowground compartments (soil) in four dynamic stages, namely Building (Bl and B2), and Mature (Ml and M2) stages, for a lowland rain forest. Nutrient concentrations in various compartments differed between the dynamic stages. Bark contains higher nutrient concentration than wood parts, both in stems and branches. Leaves contain higher nutrient concentration than wood parts, both in litterfall and litter. The concentration of K in throughfall is the highest, Ca and Mg perform similar value. Throughfall exhibits lower nutrient concentration than open area rain water. The nutrient concentration of 10-20 cm is higher than in the 0-10 cm soil depth. The phytomass values are highly variable among tree parts, diameter classes and dynamic stages. The phytomass is generally the highest in M2 and significantly different from Bl ,  Ml and B2. The phytomass of leaves in litterfall and litter is higher  than wood parts. More litterfall and litter are accumulated in mature than building phases.",

Betel vine leaves (Piper betle L.) could be used as the material of repellant.The study is aimed to test the repellency,potency, and the safety of Piper betel and patchoulli oil modified gel against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Methods: This study is an experimental study and used nulliparous (3-5 days old) female Aedes aegypti. Before the study, safety test was done which consists of an irritation test. The effectivity test used five treatments: DEET gel for positive control, piper and patchouli mixture gel, piper only gel, patchouli only gel and gel base only. The five treatments were tested as a repellant with five repetitive applications. The effectiveness of Aedes aegypti's rejection from biting the arms was analyzed using protective percentage.  Results: The irritation test showed no safety concerns. Protective percentage analysis shows that modified betel vine gel has estimated mean protective power of over 90% for 6 hours. The data showed that the modified gels has about the same protective percentage as the DEET (ratio: PP (Neem+piper)/PP (DEET) =0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.93, 1.04; p-value=0.50)Conclusion Betel vine oil with modified formulation has a potential to be utilized as Aedes aegypti mosquito repellantand is safe to be used in further repellency tests.",

Global climate change has serious impact on the changing habitat which eventually threat plants. This study has objectives: (1) to measure plant growth dependence on their microhabitat; (2) to define microhabitat variables that influence growth significantly; and (3) to formulate suitable conservation efforts for certain species.  Gonystylus bancanus is one of major timber species that has been facing high exploitation in Indonesia. This species is usually found on specific \u201cpeat swamps\u201d ecosystem. Data were collected through primary surveys in Riau Province.  Data analyses were peformed by clustering the adult base on variable of height and width of basalt area, and describing distribution pattern of the cluster. Then, Discriminant Function Analysis was used to overlay the cluster with the distribution of microhabitat characteristic consisting of altitude, slope, soil humidity, soil pH, peat depth and percentage of canopy cover. The result shows, distribution of microhabitat match with 67.4% of height distribution and 78.3% of width distribution of basalt area.  Altitude and canopy cover percentage have significant correlation with height distribution (\u03b1=0.05).  Meanwhile, altitude, canopy cover, and slope have significant correlation with width distribution of basalt area (\u03b1=0.1).  However, peat depth variable shows interesting pattern since shallower peat depth are followed by wider of basalt area. High correlation between plant growth and its microhabitat suggests that in-situ conservation is better strategy than ex-situ conservation and this is particularly true for Gonystylus bancanus conservation management",

        "description": "This study was carried out to examine the morpho-anatomical adaptation, survival, growth, biomass and nutrient uptake of lonkida (Nauclea orientalis L.) from different habitats inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on waterlogging conditions for 90 days. The results showed that the lonkida seedlings formed lenticels (100%), adventitious roots (41%) and aerenchym under waterlogging conditions. Seedling from dry land habitats, both mycorrhizal and no-mycorrhizal, have a height growth rate lower than those from other habitat types. Similarly for relative growth rates of shoot (RGRs), root (RGRr) and total (RGRt) dry weight and the ratio of root shoots. Treatments of temporal swamp habitat without waterlogging and waterlogging and savanna with waterlogging have RGRt greater than other treatments. In general, plant dry weight (root, shoot and total) and total N in roots and shoots was greater in the interactionbetween  temporalswamp habitat with no-mycorrhizal on waterlogging condition. Independently, waterlogging increase the pool of average height gain (18%), diameter (46%) and leaf area (40%), leaf length (17%) and leaf width (21%). Nonetheless, treatment waterlogging decreased variable number of leaves (9%) andAMF colonization (71%). The results of this study indicate that the seedlings from the temporal swamp has good growth and high biomass in the conditions without or with waterlogging.",

The low production of sugar in North Sumatera has caused the increase of import, but, in reality, the price of domestic sugar is higher than that of imported sugar. In order to protect the producers of domestic sugar, the government then establishes specific tariff of imported sugar. By using multiple linear regression analysis, this research was aimed to see the effect of sugar import on the price of domestic sugar. The result of the research showed that sugar import had significant influence on the price of domestic sugar in North Sumatera.",

        "description": "A survey to obtain information on pre- and postharvest handling of peanuts at farmer, collector, wholesaler and retailer levels, including  Aspergillus flavus  infection and aflatoxin  BI  contamination of peanuts collected in Cianjur regency, West Java, was conducted during the harvest period of the wet season of February 2004. The moisture contents and physical qualities of the peanuts were also determined. Thirteen and 40 dry pod samples were collected randomly from 12 farmers and 23 collectors, respectively. Seven dry kernel samples were also collected from collectors. Five and 45 dry kernel samples were collected randomly from 2 wholesalers and 45 retailers in traditional markets, respectively. Thus, a total of 110 dry peanut pod and kernel samples were collected. The results of interviews with farmers, collectors, wholesalers and retailers, and also the moisture contents and physical qualities of the peanuts arc described in this article. The percentages of samples infected by A. flavus were highest at the wholesaler as well as at retailer levels (100%, respectively), followed by those sampled at the  collectors (85.0 and 85.7%, respectively), and farmers (84.6%). The mean percentage of infected kernels in infected samples of peanuts collected from retailers was the highest (87.6%), followed by those collected from wholesalers (72.4%), collectors in the form of kernels (23.3%) and pods (17.7%), and farmers (15.2%). The range of aflatoxin  BI  contents in peanut samples collected from farmers (dry pods), collectors (dry pods), wholesalers (dry pods and kernels) and retailers (dry kernels) were < 3.6 -114.2, < 3.6 -2999.5 and < 3,6 - 34.1, < 3.6 - 6065.9, and < 3.6 - 6073.0 ppb, respectively. The highest aflatoxin B, contents at the wholesaler and retailer levels were 6065.9 ppb (in one sample) and 6073.0 ppb (in one sample), respectively. The percentage of samples contaminated with more than 15 ppb of aflatoxin BI was the highest in peanuts collected from wholesalers (80.0% of samples), followed by retailers (75.6%), farmers (38.5%) and collectors (30.0 and 14.3%). In 1999 Codex Alimcntarius Commission determined that the maximum total aflatoxin content in peanuts intended for further processing is 15 ppb, suggesting that an alarming proportion of peanuts throughout the Indonesian food chain arc in excess of this maximum limit.",

Bamyardgrass seedlings at the 2-3-lcaf stage were treated with 2.5xl07 conidia/ml from E. longirostratum  at different application frequencies (single, double and triple). In addition, aqueous extract assays were evaluated for the presence of a phytotoxic compound responsible for the virulence of the bioherbicide. Results of the study showed that disease severity significantly increased 20 days after treatment and resulted in mortality of the seedlings. Ecotypes from Perak and Lampung were most susceptible to the bioherbicide upon triple applications. Percentage dry weight reductions were 86.34 and 83.14%, respectively. Other ecotypes (Melaka, Banten and South Sulawesi) were observed to have a relatively similar response. Moreover, aqueous extracts of E. longirostratum  increased mortality up to 92.50% of bamyardgrass seedlings. These findings suggest that regular (double and triple) applications of E. longirostratum at a concentration of 2.5xl07 conidia/ml significantly increased mortality among bamyardgrass ecotypes. Mortality of the seedlings was attributed to the presence of a secondary phytotoxic metabolite.",

The objective of this study is to isolate molybdenum-reducing bacterium with the ability to grow on phenolic compounds (phenol and catechol). The screening process was carried out on a microplate. The bacterium reduced molybdenum in the form of sodium molybdate to molybdenum blue (Mo-blue). The bacterium required a narrow pH range for optimal reduction of molybdenum, i.e. between  pH 6.3 and 6.8, with temperature between 34 and 37 oC. Molybdate reduction to Mo-blue was best supported by glucose as the carbon source. However, both phenol and catechol could not support molybdate reduction. Other requirements for molybdate reduction included sodium molybdate concentrations between 15 and 30 mM, and phosphate concentration of 5.0 mM. The bacterium exhibited a Mo-blue absorption spectrum with a shoulder at 700 nm and a maximum peak near the infrared region at 865 nm. The Mo-reducing bacterium was partially identified as Enterobacter sp. strain Saw-2. The capability of this bacterium to grow on toxic phenolic compounds and to detoxify molybdenum made it a significant agent for bioremediation.",

        "description": "Eruption of Mount Merapi in 2010 caused a dense cover of Acacia decurrens Willd., which is an Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS). The dense cover happened in all areas of Mount Merapi National Park (MMNP) in Java, Indonesia. This study was aimed to describe the relationship between major natural disturbance from volcanic eruption in triggering the invasion of A.decurrens in Mount Merapi National Park. Vegetation data were collected using line transect in two different sites. The first site was Cangkringan which was affected by pyroclastic flow and the second site was Selo which was not affected by pyroclastic flow. Distribution patterns and association of A.decurrens with other species in each location was analyzed using ordination analysis of the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Microclimate such as temperature, humidity, light density and soil humidity was recorded in each location. Correlation between species abundance and microclimate data was assessed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results showed that the population of A. decurrens was more dominant in Cangkringan than in Selo site. Cangkringan site was impacted with pyroclastic flow during Mount Merapi eruption in 2010, while Selo site was not affected. In Cangkringan, A.decurrens was distributed in clump, while in Selo the plant was randomly distributed. Ordination analysis using NMDS showed that there was positive association between A.decurrens and herbaceous plant. Negative association was observed between A.decurrens and other tree species. CCA analysis showed that temperature and light density was positively correlated with A. decurrens abundance. This study showed that the IAPS invasion in MMNP was correlated with the eruption of Mount Merapi.",

        "description": "Studies on insect pollinator ecology and dynamics are very rarely carried out in traditional Indian agriculture landscapes. Indiscriminate landscape changes in the rural areas and tendencies towards crop monocultures can have significant effects on pollinator habitats and effectiveness. This study was aimed at observing insect pollinators, their visitation frequencies and timings on monsoon cucurbit crops such as Cucumis sativus L., C. pubescens Willd., Momordica charantia L., Trichonsanthes anguina L. and Luffa acutangula L. (Roxb.), in a coastal Karnataka Village.  This study was also aimed at covering the significance of the surrounding landscape elements in sustaining pollinator elements.  Bees, such as Apis dorsata, A. cerana and Trigona sp., were major visitors on all cucurbits, except snake gourd which was pollinated mainly by lepidopterans. Insect species were found to partition floral resources of any given crops between them by minimal overlapping in their visitation timings. Natural elements of the landscape around, mainly a village forest and rocky savanna furnished habitats for bees and lepidopterans. Prolifically blooming monsoon herbs on lateritic plateaus, by providing nectar resources for pollinators, presumably play key role in making the case study village well known for monsoon vegetables.",

        "description": "An appropriate preservation technology for forage such as silage needs to be developed in order to overcome the shortage of tropical forage during the dry season. A good quality of silage is obtained by decreasing the fibre contents (Neutral Detergent Fibre, Acid Detergent Fibre and lignin). The research was conducted in two stages: 1). Production and activity test of crude enzymes from Trichoderma viride and 2). Comparative test using crude enzymes from  Trichoderma viride strain QM 9414 (CETV) and commercial cellulase (Cellulase \u201cOnozuka R-10\u201d, heidelberg) on rice straw silage. The treatments were arranged as follows : P0=Untreated rice straw silage, P1=Treated with commercial cellulase at 10 IU kg-1, P2= Treated with CETV at 3.8 IU kg-1, P3=Treated with CETV at 7.6 IU kg-1  and P4= Treated with CETV at 11.4 IU kg-1 of fresh rice straw. All treatments were enriched with 5% molasses. The result of the research indicated that: 1). The activity of crude enzymes from Trichoderma viride strain QM 9414 (CETV) was 1.52 IUml-1. 2). The addition of both enzymes did not decrease dry matter of rice straw silage; however, organic matter significantly decreased (p",

We hope that the country's political communicators make good planning. Therefore, this article gives an overview of the basic political communication planning. This article identifies the characteristics of Indonesian peoples from the theory of sociology and anthropology. This then scrutinized it on the basis of historical reality, which the author experienced in childhood, especially in author residence. The results show that in fact Indonesia has a distinctive political communication, based on the Indonesia democratic system: Demokrasi Gotong Royong or well known as Demokrasi Pancasila. In the world it can be regarded as a form of monistic emancipatory model. Unfortunately, democracy got eroded by two trajectories of globalization which resulted in two figures causing a history accident. Efforts of Sukarno's and Gusdur-Mega's temporarily got stuck. But it's not in uselessness. There is the light of hope that in the future time, peoples of Indonesia keep building characters. Hence, it's suggested to develop conceptually, policy, and socialization on the model of democratic Indonesia.",

Sequenceanalysis of 16S-rRNA indicated that L-07 was similar (98%) to  Geobacillus stearothermophilus, aspecies of thermophilic aerobic bacteria. We found that  G. stearothermophilus L-07 producedextracellular \u03b2-1,4-mannanases, but no \u03b2-manosidase and \u03b1-galactosidase activities. The growth of L-07reached its maximum (3.0 x 106 cell/ml) at 12-20 hours, while the highest  \u03b2-mannanase activity (0.52U/ml) was observed in culture medium after 36 hours of cultivation at 60oC. The medium containinglocust bean gum was the best for producing extracellular \u03b2-1,4-mannanases compared with kolang kaling,konjak, and palm kernel meal. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analysis demonstrated that crude mannanasecomplex of L-07 from locust bean gum containing medium comprised three active bands with molecularweight of 85, 73 and 50 kDa.",

The study was conducted in the PT Berau Coal area of Binungan, Lati and Sambarata site, Berau regency, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Research using a randomized completely block design with the age of re-vegetation as treatments, three replication and three sites as blocks. Sampling unit was selected using a purposive sampling method that is based on the re-vegetation management, including: (i) S1: forest area without mining activities (baseline), (ii) S2: initial re-vegetation, plant age < 1 year, (iii) S3 : medium re-vegetation, plant age 3 years, (iv) further re-vegetation, plant age > 5 years. Soil sample was collected from 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil depth in each treatment at three locations, then analyzed for soil  physic and chemistry. Soil of Typic Hapludult on forest land without coal mining has a C-organic (1.87 %), N-total (0.14 %), available-P (31.40 ppm), exchangeable-K (0.11 me/100g), pH (3.98), CEC (10.72 me/100g) and base saturation (17 %). Opened coal mining has led the soil layer becomes exposed and a declining in soil quality drastically. Land closure with the top soil media has been quite able to improve soil properties in rehabilitation areas, but not suitable as media for plant growth, and highly susceptible for further degradation. Land rehabilitation and re-vegetation with fast growing and adaptive pioneer plants such as: Sengon, Acacia, Sungkai, Melina, Angsana, Jarak and Legume Cover Crop (LCC) in the rehabilitation area of coal mining, gave significant effect on the increasing of  C-organic, N-total and soil pH. Re-vegetation with fast growing species after 5-year-old has returned the soil chemical properties that are equivalent or even better than thier condition in moist tropical forests without open coal mining.",

From historical background of Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book) has been founded the same task and tool in history of salvation (HP). Beginning from decisive issues of Ahl al-Kitab, Arkoun works out the concept of \"The society of the Book\". He uses a deconstruction method to find vocabulary, methods and intellectual attitudes relevant to the presentation of Revelation with: a. the requirement of modern historical analysis; b. the philosophical evaluation of the implicit or explicit postulates of teaching and; c. the benefit of modern rationality and scientific thought. From these views, the writer tries to elaborate the significances of Arkoun's thought as a basic need of dialogues and the development of discourses in multi-faiths and multi-religions societies.",

The Anak Dalam Tribe of Jambi Province uses the leaves of H. capitata to cure external and internal wounds. This study was aimed at identifying and analyzing secretory structure, histochemistry and phytochemical content of H. capitata leaves.  The results showed that H. capitata leaves have secretory structures in the form of peltate, capitate and uniseriate glandular trichomes on the upper and lower leaf surfaces, with idioblast cells scattered throughout the leaf mesophyll. Histochemical tests indicated that the peltate trichomes have four head cells, containing alkaloids and terpenoids. This study classified capitate trichomes into two types: 1. type I has one stalk cell and two head cells, all containing  alkaloids, terpenoids and lipophilic compounds; 2. type II has long stalk cells consisting of seven to ten cells with one head cell, all containing alkaloids and terpenoids. Uniseriate glandular trichomes of H. capitata leaves consist of four to eight cells containing alkaloids and terpenoids. The idioblast cells are round-shaped and contain lipophilic compounds. GC-MS analysis showed that H. capitata leaves  contain terpenoid compounds assumed to serve as anti-infective agents, including l-limonene, eugenol, farnesol isomers A, d-nerolidol, hexahydrofarnesol and neophytadiene.",

Therefore, the researchers wanted to generate natural material-based medical textile. The objectives and targets will be achieved from this research, is utilizing waste stem of banana post harvest into something more valuable as well as making modeling results done. The research results from this banana trunk fiber as material for the manufacture of baby diapers are environmentally friendly and have a high absorbent against water. This research was conducted with the experimental method to generate optimal achievement, namely by doing the processing post harvest banana stems. The first stage is looking for post harvest banana stems which are usually discarded. The next step is extracting stem of banana leaf into tow fiber, tow fiber processing became the staple through the process of relaxing, washing, cutting and opening. And the end result will be either web (non woven fiber) which will be in the laboratory test on humidity, power and fiber dimensions. Then make the modeling of laboratory test results. From the results of the experiment, the value will be in the predictions is the numeric data. This is usually made as a reference or basis for making the modeling that can predict. The prediction are more focus on the identification of trend of the distribution on the test data generated",

The advantage of flowshoplays on it simple material flow. Therefore, the material transportation time can be minimized and the total production time is shortened respectively. Generally, flowshop scheduling applies Johnson algorithm, Campbell, Dudek and Smith (CDS). Nevertheless, those algorithms are just an approach. Therefore it can't provide an optimal solution. This article explain the flexible flowshop scheduling with Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). Every parts type scheduled will not enter the same work station and some work station are served manually by an operator that leads to a dynamics process time. Simulation is applied to estimate the process time in those work station. A case study is utilize for this purpose. The makespan of the proposed model exhibits a 14 minutes shorter that the initial time.",

Therefore farmers' response also increases their organic products, including those in  Serdang Bedagai District. Without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the production cost and the production of organic rice was generally lower than that of in-organic rice. However, most consumers are willing to pay higher price for the organic rice, therefore farmers' income from organic rice will be determined by the change in revenue (due to the decrease in production and the increase in the selling price) and production costs (due to the decrease in chemical fertilizers and pesticides USAge). Result of the research shows that the quality and the price of organic rice was increasing from time to time. Estimation of the multiple regression shows that the organic rice productivity, the cows' urine price, and the employees' wages significantly influence the organic rice farmers income. However, the seedling price, manure price, organic pesticide price, and marketing cost do not have significant influence on the organic rice farmers income.",

        "description": "Sweet star fruit (Carambola averrhoa L.) is one type of fruit plants that is widespread in Indonesia. Sweet star fruit contained high concentration of vitamin A and vitamin C. Utilization of sweet star fruit as nutraceuticals products that are rich in vitamin A and C are still relatively rare. Demands of people who want to get an interesting kind of preparation and easy to use push of this study which aims to produce gummy candies. Preparations of gummy candies was made in 5 formulations based on a combination of gummy base (mannitol and corn syrup) with a ratio of 50%: 50%, 40%: 60%, 25%: 75%, 60%: 40%, 75%: 25%. Making sweet star fruit juice using freeze drying method then organoleptic test was conducted on the sweet star fruit juice. Testing physical properties of gummy candies include organoleptic test, weight uniformity test, and preference level (hedonict test) by the respondent and then the test results were compared with the requirements in the literature. Formula 3 with gummy base containing ratio of mannitol:corn syrup (25%: 75%) is the best formula that is compared with other formula, with a coefficient of variation for weight uniformity test was 2.09%.",

        "description": "Coccidiosis is one of the most widely distributed parasitic diseases of cattle throughout the world. Coccidiosis infection in ruminants was caused by Eimeria spp.  The objective of this study was to determine Eimeria species composition and various factors influencing Eimeria oocysts shedding in dairy farm.  This study was conducted with a cross-sectional study design in dairy farm in South Bandung District from July 2014 to January 2015. Samples were obtained from 400 dairy cattle (196 cattle at age &lt; 6 months, 37 cattle at age 6 - 12 months and 167 cattle at age &gt; 12 months). Fecal samples were collected, examined and counted for Eimeria species composition and numbers of oocysts per gram of feces (OPG) using McMaster technique. A questionnaire was completed for individual dairy cattle farmer to record information about cattle's health and husbandry. The effect of cattle's sex, age and type of pen flooring to OPG values were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed followed by Dunn test as a multiple comparison test. Ten species of Eimeria were identified in all infected cattle. Among the Eimeria identified species, Eimeria bovis was found to have the highest prevalence (42.5%), followed subsequently by Eimeria wyomingensis (39.1%), Eimeria bukidnonensis (32.4%), Eimeria pellita (26.3%), Eimeria auburnensis (19.6%), Eimeria zuernii (17.3%), Eimeria cylindrica (3.9%), Eimeria canadensis (3.9%), Eimeria Brasiliensis (3.4%) and Eimeria alabamensis (1.1%). The numbers of oocysts shed was correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with cattle's sex and age as well type of pen flooring which influenced the infection pressure. Younger calves aged less than 6 months shed the highest amount of Eimeria oocysts than older cattle. Many factors may cause the increasing number of OPG in fecal samples. Therefore, it is important to keep good sanitation and control of Eimeria among dairy cattle in the KPBS Pangalengan dairy farm.",

        "description": "For effective teak plantation management, early detection system in controlling teak mistletoe requires various basic information, including degree of infestation and accuracy of the species names. Mistletoe infestations in teak and mistletoe species name have been reported, but there are still problems in identifying the correct species or subspecies due to morphological similarity.  The objective of this study was to clarify the species identity of hemi-parasitic mistletoe plants, which were found in teak Clonal Seed Orchard (CSO) in Padangan, East Java Province, Indonesia using DNA barcodes. Species identification of teak mistletoe based on leaf morphological characteristics and universal DNA barcode regions (i.e. matK and rbcL) were carried out. The results showed that the Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) could differentiate Dendrophthoe pentandra and Macrosolen tetragonus based on leaf morphological characteristics. Variables having high correlation to distinguish both species were length of petiole,  width of the widest leaf, number of secondary leaf veins, leaf base shape, aspect ratio, form factor and perimeter ratio of diameter.  The results of  DNA barcoding showed that the two DNA barcode regions presented good  amplification and sequence results. Both DNA barcode regions successfully differentiated two species i.e. D. pentandra and M. tetragonus which belong to Loranthaceae family and have similar leaf morphological characteristics. Those regions were also able to identify Viscum articulatum and other species belonging to Santalaceae family. These results suggested that the two DNA regions could become recommended universal DNA barcode for identifying teak mistletoe.",

The popularity of WhatsApp has raised the need of better understanding on how it stores chat archives within the application. This knowledge is useful in term of mobile forensics purposes. In this paper, the latest version of WhatsApp applications in two major platforms, Android and iOS are used in order to explore the file systems and database, to learn where and how the messages and other files are stored, and then to analyze the strength and the weakness of this implementation. The main finding of this research is that WhatsApp uses different file system and database structure in its iOS and Android application. While the database in iOS platform is well structured and makes use of good normalization, the database in Android platform is much simpler and stored as encrypted file within the file system. Furthermore, this research also shows that it is relatively easy to recover all messages history from the database in both platforms; given the Android devices have been rooted but not necessarily jailbreak the iOS devices. Based on this finding, it is possible to develop an application to read WhatsApp database and display it in a more user-friendly format to make forensic activity much easier.",

Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be used as potential biocontrol agents.  PGPR with siderophores is among compounds having important role in disease suppression.  This experiment was conducted to select and characterize the siderophore-producing rhizobacteria from tomato and to determine their potential as antagonistic agents for R. solanacearum.  Candidates of the PGPR were isolated from tomato grown in West Java Province, Indonesia. The isolates were detected as siderophore-producing bacteria using CAS medium. Among 29 isolates producing siderophore and having negative result on hypersensitivity reaction, two isolates provided the widest diameter of inhibition zone toward R. solanacearum.  Both isolates were CP1C and CP2D with diameter of inhibition zone up to 3.6 and 7.0 mm, respectively.  Based on the sequence of 16S rDNA, isolate CP1C was identified as Brevundimonas sp., while isolate CP2D was identified as Enterobacter sp.  Both bacteria did not cause negative effect on the increasing plant height and dry weight of the plants, compared with control.",

Stiffened thin plate structure is a structure that  consists of frame and sheet that used on  vehicle structure because of requirement low volume materials. The principle of  SSW is installation of sheeting on the frame is done by pulling the sheeting in hot conditions so the sheeting after joined with the frame has the flat surface. Lap joints of  SS 400 with thickness of  1 mm dan 3 mm were made using Gas Metal Arc Welding. The preheat temperature that used were 50\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C. The mechanical properties were measured with respect to strength and hardness while physical properties were examined based on the distortion, micro and macrostructure. Results show that the distortion of weld metal with preheat temperatures 50\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C are 1.02; 2.06; and 2.22 mm respectively. This values is better than weld metal without  SSW that has distortion 3.02 mm. The tensile  strength of weld metals with SSW method  is 20% higher than the weld metal  without SSW. Ferrite and pearlite structure appeared in based metal and HAZ region while weld metal had acicular ferrite and grain boundary ferrite structure.",

        "description": "Environmental accounting is used to identify hidden costs and improve industrial performance in the field of environmental management. The identification of costs is done by assessing the activities and benefits of environmental management from cost standpoint. The existence of environmental accounting is also used as a management and information tool to stakeholders regarding environmental performance in optimizing social responsibility. The research was conducted at Pabrik Gula Lestari in Ngrombot Nganjuk. This study aims to identify and explain the environmental accounting and environmental activities in order optimizing social responsibility at Pabrik Gula Lestari. Type of research is descriptive research by qualitative approach. The data sources used are interviews with key informants, observation and documentation. Based on the analysis indicates that the Pabrik Gula Lestari has implemented environmental accounting but the reforestation cost was budgeted at cost of donations. The analysis also revealed that Installation Management Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and bowler machines need additional maintenance costs to minimize the pollution so it does not interfere with public health. If Pabrik Gula Lestari wants to improve the quality of the environment for social responsibility, Pabrik Gula Lestari should optimize equipment maintenance and provide for public health programs.",

Slavery has been existed in Mauritania since European performed a trading contact with the African. Modern slavery is a condition of one person possessing or controlling another person in such as a way as to significantly deprive that person of their individual liberty, with the intention of exploiting that person through their use, management, profit, transfer or disposal. Modern slavery includes slavery, slavery-like practices (such as debt bondage, forced marriage and sale or exploitation of children), human trafficking and forced labour, and other practices described in key international treaties, voluntarily ratified by nearly every country in the world. The form of modern slavery in Mauritania is slavery based descent, also known as hereditary or chattel slavery, mean that slave status is inherited generation to generation and is deeply rooted in social castes and the wider social system. Many victims are the Black Moors (black African) came from both rural and urban areas. Actually, modern slavery not only occurs in Africa but also in other countries such as Asia and Europe. In this research, the author is using the group behavior analysis level which focused on the role of international organization. This research is using a pluralism perspective in international relations and organizational theory of Clive Archer. WFF\u0080\u0099s role in handling modern slavery in Mauritania by prevention program. In efforts to handle modern slavery in Mauritania, WFF faces some obstacles; the lack of public knowledge about the dangers of modern slavery, lack of resource capacity in Mauritania and lack of monitoring and evaluation of the Mauritanian government cause the victims of modern slavery increase from year to year.Keywords: slavery, modern slavery, Mauritania, walk free foundation (wff), global slavery index (gsi), walkfree movemenT.",

The objective of the study was to describe Begonia species found in respective forest sites, to gather information on abiotic factors and to find the influences of these abiotic factors to the abundance of Begonia species. Three species were identified as B. multangula, B. Baliensis and B. longifolia. There were two form of B. longifolia, white and red. The multivariate analysis (PCA) showed that abiotic factors measured were relatively similar among plots. In addition, no particular abiotic factor, from multivariate analysis, showed specific influence on Begonia species frequency.  Interestingly, the multivariate analysis also implied that B. latifolia has different microclimate preference between forms (white and red).  The abundance, refers to the frequency, of all of species in two forests was similar (t-test, p=0.061). Pooling the data from the fourty plots (two forest sites) and white and red forms of B. longifolia together, B. multangula and B. longifolia found were similarly abundant between species (t- test, p=0.460).",

Four habitat types comprising 6 plant communities could be distinguished:  1. Grassland, Imperata cylindrica - Ipomea aquatica community; 2. Open forest: a. open forest transitional to grassland, Ficus robusta - Dendrochide sp. community, b. open forest after logging, Musa paradisiaca \u2013 Callamus longipina community, c. open forest regenerated after logging,  Diospyros hebecarpa-Lepinopsis ternatensis  community, d. open forest on rocky soil, regenerated after logging, Smilax malacensis-Pandanus tectorius community; 3. Undisturbed (\u201cprimary) closed forest, Sommeria leuchophylla\u2013Paraltropis glabra community.  The forest wallaby has especially been noted in grassland, in open forest with only little logging activity and in undisturbed closed forest. It was however not registered from the forests with clear logging influence. D. muelleri appears to be very sensitive to human disturbance. Our results indicate that vegetation structure, food plant availability and possibly also vegetation composition is less important than human disturbance. There is a strong negative relation between on one hand presence of the forest wallaby and on the other hand logging, distance to villages and hunting.",

The parent has to do an assessment against their child so that they could understand about how and how much the child grows. One of assessment methods that could be used is a Denver Development Screening Test (DDST) or usually called Denver II. Denver II contains 4 sectors which tested against children, those: Social Personal, Soft Motoric, Language, and Hard Motoric. An assessment using the Denver II could be conducted not only in the clinic or hospital but also in patient home using a help from a psychologist or other health workers as a tester. A DDST application based on Android was designed to facilitate a tester doing an assessment out of the clinic or hospital. Data of an assessment managed over a decision support system that build alongside a DDST application. Application was constructed based on instrument of Denver II, which are question form and manual test. Application testing conducted in two ways: USAbility testing, which could show whether an application could run well as the need lists; and validation testing using Single Decision Threshold have sensitivity amount of 100%, specificity amount of 87.5% and value apps performance amount of 90%. Using Coefficient Cohen's Kappa has an accuracy amount of 0.74 (Strong).",

Coal was screened in the mesh size of -6 +8 and plastic collected from waste grocery bags were cut in small sizes. Coal and plastic were mixed together in the percentages of 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% of plastic. Coal and plastic mixtures were feeded in the fixedbed pyrolyzer with natural zeolite addition then heated until desired temperature (400oC, 450oC and 500oC) in absence oxygen. The pyrolysis vapor produced from heating was condensed by separated water cooling. The condensation liquid formed was collected and analyzed using GCMS to determain the composition of liquid fraction. This reseach results that the higher temperature pyrolyzer the higher conversion of coal and plastic mixtures is by reducing char product. In addition, by the plastic added in the coal pyrolysis enriches alkane compounds and reduces percentages of PAH compounds. The natural zeolit addition affects in the increase of percentage of alcohol compounds with the alkene compounds reduction",

Previous research in Gianyar Regency indicated that taeniasis prevalence was 23.8%, with the highest prevalence found in the sub-district of Sukawati. This high prevalence is partly influenced by the community practices and a culture of raw beef consumption in this area. This research used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data was collected through cross sectional analysis of 80 samples of raw beef consumers (interviews on risk behaviours and past experience). Fecal samples from these respondents were also taken and examined for taeniasis saginata infection. Qualitative data was collected through participatory observation and in-depth interviews with raw beef foodstall owners. The research findings indicated that the percentage of taeniasis saginata infection was found predominantly in the 15-44 age group, were male and did not have a formal education. Bivariate analysis indicated that the most significant factors were gender (p=0.018), location of foodstall (p=0.001) and respondent lawar consumption frequency (p=0.013). Multivariate analysis using cox regression methods found that the location of foodstall had a significant correlation with the occurence of taenaisis saginata (p=0.003). Recommendations include education for raw beef providers and upscaled testing of consumers and further research into other variables such as livestock slaughter behaviours and meat preparation protocols.",

Palm kernel shell was mixed with plastic in the persentages of 0%, 10%, 20% dan 30%. The mixtures of palm kernel shell and plastic were feeded in the fixedbed pyrolyzer with the natural zeolite as catalyst. Pyrolyzer was heated and controlled in the temperature of 400oC, 450oC and 500oC. Vapor produced by pyrolysis process was condensed by seperated water cooling. Liquid condensation was collected and measured its weight then analyzed by using GCMS to determain the composition of bio-oil formed from this processes. The research results that the higher temperature pyrolyzer the higher conversion of palm kernel shell and plastic mixtures is by reducing char product. The addition of natural zeolit as catalyst affects in the increase of phenol, alkane and alkene compounds with the reduction of acid compounds.",

        "description": "This research tries to address a problem on how media (Media Indonesia) construct texts/ reality news about corruption of Indonesian parliement's member in the case of flow of funds of Bank Indonesia in Indonesian parliement and emerging discourse in the process of its construction. The goal of this research is to know how Media Indonesia construct texts/news about corruption of Indonesian parliement's member pertaining flow of funds of  Bank Indonesia in Indonesian parliement. The assumptions on which this problems based are: first, news diccourse makes up integral part of framing process in a number of issues. Second: when media report about the content, it is indicated that there is ideology factor and power influencing news making. Third, there is  certain dominant groups  which tend to be able to control undominant groups or even to marginalize them by predominating media. Those reasons guide this research to harness paradigm of constructivism. In this relation, theoretical concept used is: News is a reality constructed and media discourse. To answer this problem, this research uses analytical method of Norman Fairclough. The result shows that in constructing corruption done by parliaments member in Bank Indonesia's flow of funds, media direct into emerging a discourse in case of BI's flow of funds that parliament members are more dominantly determined as corruptors. In that position, parliament's members are positioned unfairly to each other: as main players, as proponent players, and players who are victimize for other party's interests. Meanwhile, the discourse that parliament's members regarded as whistle-blowers in the embezzlement of Bank Indonesia's flow of funds, never become media's choice. Emerging that discourse, theoretically, it is enabled by \u2013in constructivism's view- subject (media) are regarded as central factor of discourse activity which is able to control in order to achieve media's vested interest.   Penelitian ini mencoba menjawab permasalahan tentang bagaimana media (Media Indonesia) mengkonstruksi teks/berita realitas korupsi Anggota DPR RI terkait kasus aliran dana BI di DPR RI dan wacana apa yang muncul dalam pengkonstruksian itu. Tujuan penelitian yaitu  Ingin mengetahui cara Suratkabar Media Indonesia dalam mengkonstruksi teks/berita tentang korupsi Anggota DPR RI dalam  kasus aliran dana BI di DPR RI. Asumsi-asumsi yang mendasari permasalahan ini adalah: pertama, wacana berita merupakan bagian integral dari proses framing sejumlah isu. Kedua, pada saat media memberitakan isinya diindikasikan adanya faktor-faktor ideologi dan kekuasaan yang memberikan pengaruh dalam pengemasan berita. Ketiga, adanya kelompok yang dominan cenderung dapat mengontrol kelompok yang tidak dominan bahkan memarjinalkan mereka dengan menguasai media. Alasan-alasan tersebut mengarahkan penelitian ini menggunakan paradigma konstruktivis. Dalam kaitan ini, konsep-konsep teoritik yang digunakan yaitu: Berita sebagai Konstruksi Realitas dan Wacana Media. Untuk menjawab permasalahan, penelitian ini menggunakan metode analisis teks Norman Fairclough. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa dalam pengkonstruksian realitas tentang korupsi Anggota DPR RI terkait kasus aliran dana BI di DPR RI, media mengarahkannya pada munculnya wacana bahwa dalam kasus aliran dana BI tadi, anggota dewan lebih dominan dipilih dalam posisi sebagai pemain korupsi. Sebagai pemain korupsi, anggota dewan diposisikan secara berbeda, yakni sebagai pemain utama, sebagai pemain pendukung, dan sebagaimana pemain yang menjadi korban kepentingan pihak lain. Sementara wacana anggota dewan sebagai wasit dalam kasus korupsi aliran dana BI, tidak pernah menjadi pilihan media.  Munculnya pewacanaan yang demikian, secara teoritis ini dimungkinkan karena dalam pandangan konstruktivis, subjek yang dalam hal ini media, dianggap sebagai faktor sentral dalam kegiatan wacana yang memiliki kemampuan dalam melakukan kontrol guna mencapai maksud-maksud tertentu dari media.",

A fixed bed reactor was utilized to investigate the effect of pyrolysis temperature and biomass particle size on the yield of bio-oil, tar, biochar and gas and properties of bio-oil. The pyrolysis temperature was ranging from 450 to 550oC, while variations of particle size were -20+30 Mesh and -30+40 Mesh. The operation conditions of the pyrolysis were 15 minutes of resident time, 25oC/minute of heating ramp and 0.5 L/min of N2 flowrate.  Optimum conditions obtained for the maximum bio-oil yield (28.11 %wt) were 550oC and -30+40 Mesh of particle size. However, pyrolysis for -20+30 Mesh of biomass particle size had optimum temperature on 500oC which had 27.89%wt of bio-oil yield. On the other hand, all bio-oils were characterized in detail by determining their density, viscosity, pH, acetic acid content and heating value. Bio-oils produced have the following properties: density of 1.0667-1.0867 gr/ml, viscosity of 1.3034-1.7821 cP,  pH of 2.3835-2.7865, acetic acid content of 0.4320-0.5600 mg/ml bio-oil, dan heating value of  9.3168-10.8173 MJ/kg. The highest heating value is contented by bio-oil produced with 550oC of temperature pyrolysis and -30+40 Mesh of biomass particle size.",

Production of root biomass was taken as a measure to quantify the influence of macro-elements added to the minimal medium. The levels of phosphorus when adjusted to 1.19 mg/1 and 1.09 mg/l, lead to dry root biomass production at par with the control. Attempts made to lower the amount of impurities in phytagel by de-ionization using different alkalies, proved NaOH to give the best results in terms of relatively high amount of root biomass. In an in vitro dual culture system with carrot as host and Gigaspora margarita as the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, phytagel impurities helped to produce maximum number of infection units and auxiliary cells when phytagel was added to the minimal medium.",

Use of at least 10 adult weevils to infest test samples containing at least 40 seeds for a 5-day oviposition period should produce reliable results when infesting mungbean seeds with unsexed weevils. Dry heat treatment was very effective in disinfesting mungbean seeds from the bean weevil in different developmental stages. It improved germination depending upon the condition of the seed before tr eatment and certain temperature limits. A suggested  treatment for mungbean dismfestation using dry heat would be 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C for  two-and one-hour treatments, respectively at 12% moisture content. For seeds in bulk, 60\u00b0C is much preferred.",

        "description": "Gender inequality still exists in Indonesia on various sectors. However, the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measurement (GEM) showed an increasing trends in recent years. The increase in GDI and GEM index indicates the gender equality in education, labor and business opportunities. Meanwhile, the gender equality in access to credit and capital is still unclear. This paper discusses the gender issue in credit policy, accessibility and utilization in Indonesia using literature review. Gender factor is not explicitly considered in credit policy which means that men and women have the equality to obtain and utilize credit. In reality, the low proportion of women borrower indicates that women accessibility towards credit is lower than men. Increasing in women accessibility towards credit will bring positive effect, economically and socially, for the women themselves and their family. The important implication is that increasing in business opportunities and labor for women will increase the accessibility of women to credit.",

Various fungal species predominated at different moisture conditions and storage periods. The fungi observed belong to the groups of Aspergillus flavus-oryzae, A. glaucus, A. mdulans. A. candidus, A. versicolor, A. terreus and A. Niger and  an unidentified species of Penicillium, Trichoconiella, Curvularia, Fusarium, Syncephalastrum  and Verticillium. The predominant storage fungi were A. fla\\iis-oryzae and A. candidus whereas, the predominant field fungi were Trichoconiella sp., Cun-ularia sp. and Syncepfialastrwn sp. A decrease in the number of field fungi and an increase in the number of storage fungi with storage time were observed. Storage fungi were noted as early as five weeks after storage at moisture contents from 9.3 to 18.33%. The percentage germination of paddy remained high when stored at moisture contents of 9.3 to 14% but decreased with storage time at 14.5 to 18.33% moisture  content. The  percentage germination of paddy  reached  a peak  at  10-15 weeks of  storage. A  significant negative correlation between percent germination and moisture content was observed. At 14.5-18.33% moisture content, the germination of stored paddy decreased with a marked increase of storage molds. Changes  in grain whiteness was  not  affected by moisture  content. However,  a  decrease  in percent  whiteness  and translucency was noted after 25 weeks of storage.",

So back to nature is a smart move and wise for the condition. Innovation of the natural material made to eliminate weaknesses in their mechanical properties. Particle Wood or particle board  can be used as a component of composite sandwich. In this research, the manufacture of composite sandwich with skin  of agave or sisal fibers (random distribution) and core of composit  sandwich is  particle board. Variable thickness of the core wood used is 10 and 15 mm. In the process of making the sandwich composite wood core is made through compression molding process by means of pressing the composite mold. The presence alkali treatment of agave or sisal  fibre at 2 % Concentration NaOH solvent. The results showed a composite sandwich with a span length of 60 mm has an average bending moments in composite sandwich with 10 mm thick core of 24,4 N/mm2 and for 15 mm thick core of 16,3  N/mm2. Sampling Bending Strength Test 3 pieces each test sample. Macro Fracture from bending test  is dominated the damage intererface failure between core and skins,  fiber pull out,  failed to pull and shear fracture core.

The increasing channeling of credit, usually accompanied with an increase in troubled loans or bad debts on the credit given. The research result of PT. BPR Nusamba Wlingi in the credits that is not paid off by a debtor. Working capital credit who granted each year has increased. And there is a working capital credit granted having arrears. Based on the results, it can be concluded that management control in the provision of working capital loan to PT. BPR Nusamba Wlingi is good enough, but there is some weakness that must be considered because it could cause credit arrear that result in non performing loan. Credit management control needs to do in order to bank lending to avoid losses due to the return of loans extended, so as to minimize the risk that may occur. The greater the percentage of Non Performing Loan the assessment of the bank's health getting worse but instead if percentage of Non Performing Loan is small then the assessment of the health of the banks is getting better.",

        "description": "Preposition was a word that completes the meaning of the verb and noun in the sentence structure of Arabic. The use of prepositions in Arabic was truly significant in understanding the Arabic text, especially holy texts. The question was why prepositions were used in sentences such, whereas the other joints could also give the same meaning? Article presented an analysis of syntax-semantics of prepositions \u0641\u064a Fi and \u0639\u0644\u0649cAla in al-Quran al-Karim across science of Arabic rhetoric (Balagha). Data were restricted to partial phrase \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0644\u0627\u0644 and \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649 ever discussed by Ibn Athir. There are 29 places in the Quran that mention \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0644\u0627\u0644 and 6 points for \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649. Critical analysis based on the discipline of linguistics is expected to expose the use of prepositions in Arabic from the precision and beauty of the Arabic language itself. Summary of the study suggest that research on elements of the rhetoric says that other reasonable tasks highlighted in subsequent studies.",

One of the necessary strategies in dealing with AEC is to optimize the role of the State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN). With regards to the implementation of the AEC, it is important to provide adequate regulation in order to ensure legal certainty for BUMN. The main purpose of this research is to discover form of national regulation that can maximize business opportunity for BUMN in AEC era. It is found that the existing regulations have not yet given business opportunity for BUMN in AEC era. The existing regulations are contradictory one to another especially relating to the status of the state finance inserted as capital into BUMN. In addition, the Constitutional Court decision Number 48/PUU-XI/2013 maintained that the capital inserted into BUMN is considered as part of the state finance. Therefore, this brings about fundamental impact on future cases since the nature of the Constitutional Court decision is erga omnes.",

        "description": "This research is about the implications of constitutional review by Constitutional Court in realizing maqashid sharia backgrounded by the ambiguity of whether or not to use the maqashid syariah as a benchmark in constitutional review. The research is to observe the use of maqashid syariah as a benchmark and the implications of the legal system in Indonesia. The method used is normative legal research focusing on several decisions of Constitutional Court. The results of the study show that the Constitutional Court accommodates maqashid sharia. Based on the analysis of Constitutional Court Verdict Number 2-3/ PUU-V/2007, Verdict Number 12/PUU-V/2007, Verdict Number 68/PUU-XII/2014, Verdict Number 85/PUU-XI/2013 show that in constitutional review, the Constitutional Court uses the maqashid syariah as a benchmarks (in the framework of  Pancasila) in line with the idealization of Baldatun Thayyibatun wa Rabbun Ghafur meant to maqashid syariah focusing on maintaining the benefit of religion/din, maintaining the benefit of the soul/nafs, maintaining the benefit of reason/aql, maintaining the benefit of descendants/nasl, and maintaining the benefit of wealth/mal) has been accommodated and applied in constitutional review. The implication is that maqashid sharia becomes one of benchmarks in constitutional review and the Constitutional Court can intepret the contextualization of maqashid sharia in various cases.",

To maintain and guarantee the neutrality the integrity, cohesiveness, and unity of the State Civil Apparatus from the influence of political parties and to focus all attention, mind and energy on the tasks charged, the ASN is prohibited from becoming a member and/or administrator of political parties. In the past, the neutrality of the ASN began in the Old Order, when the issuance of Presidential Regulation Number 2 of 1959 concerning the Prohibition of Civil Servants and Public Officials in Political Parties. Furthermore, this Presidential Regulation was followed up and expanded with a Circular Letter of the President of the Republic of Indonesia Number 2 of 1959 concerning Prohibition of Membership of Political Parties for State Officials that Carry Out State Obligations Outside of Positions which they hold. Furthermore, in the New Order period, Law Number 8 of 1974 concerning the Principles of Staffing, while during the Reform Order was issued, among others, Law Number 43 of 1999, Civil servants must be neutral from the influence of all groups and parties and not discriminatory in providing services to the public.

        "description": "In environmental protection and management, the main effort is to prevent pollution and damage on environment instead of repressing the damages occurred. Permit is one of preventive measures and becomes a principle in Administrative Law. Permits can be seen as government's tool as judicial preventive and used as an administrative instrument to control people's behavior. Environmental permit can be seen as preventive measure, because it always related to orders and obligations that must be obeyed by the holder. On the other hand, environmental permit also function as repressive instrument to counter environmental problems due to human activities, including mining. The norm's obscurity on the supervision of environmental permits in in Law No. 32 Year 2009 on Environmental Protection and Management (hereafter will refer as UUPPLH) is an indicator for the lack of the objective results.Based on type, this research  focuses the study on the Environmental permit as an absolute requirement. Normatively, the principle of environmental permit as stipulated in Environmental Law regulates that every business and/or activity which required an Environmental Impact Analysis document or UKL-UPL should also hold an environmental permit. The purpose of Environmental permits is to maintain the preservation of environmental functions while also prevent and counter environmental pollution and damage due to human activities. Based on this construction, permits plays a very important role in environmental activity. Exploitation of natural resources has a significant impact on the environment, thus based on Article 22 paragraph (1) of Environmental Law these activities requires an Environment Impact Analysis. Important impacts as detailed in Article 22 paragraph (2) at empirical level still occurs so the goal of preventing pollution and damage as the objective of environmental permits still has not been achieved.",

        "description": "The effects of milling degree and type of bag on fungal infection of stored milled rice were investigated together with some chemical contents (glucose, amylose, protein and total lipid contents), and changes in moisture content. Rice var. IR 64 with different milling degrees (85, 90, 95 and 100%) packed in  jute and polypropylene bags (1 kg of milled rice/bag) were stored under laboratory conditions with temperature between 24.3-27.3 C and relative humidity 52.6-81.9% for 3 months. The initial moisture content (m.c.) of milled rice was \u00b1 14%. Three replications (3 bags) were used for each treatment. Each bag was put individually and was arranged randomly on a wooden pallet. The results showed that in general, the increase of milling degree and duration of storage decreased the m.c. Type of bag did not give significant differences on the m.c.  Twenty eight fungal species were isolated from rice with different milling degree and bag type during storage. The predominant species was Aspergillus Candidas. Total fungal population decreased with  the  increase of milling degree and duration of storage. Bag type did not give significant differences on total  fungal population. In general, the increase of milling degree increased glucose content. Glucose content in milled rice packed in jute bag was higher than that in polypropylene bag. Glucose content tended to decrease with the  increase of storage duration. The increase of milling degree increased amylose content in milled rice. Amylose content of milled rice packed in jute bag was lower than that in polypropylene bag. The increase of storage duration decreased amylose content in milled rice. In general, protein content decreased with the increase of milling degree and duration of storage. 1 type did not give significant differences on protein content. Total  lipid content decreased with  the  increase of milling degree and duration of storage. Total  lipid content of milled rice packed in jute bag was lower than that in polypropylene bag, but based on chemical  analysis the difference was not significant. Based on statistical analyses, correlation between the m.c. and total lipid content with total fungal  population was positive. There was no correlation between glucose, amylose and protein contents with total fungal population. Rice with high milling degree can be stored safely for long period, but it has low chemical (nutritional) contents.",

Minimal Linux system is a Linux system that use a few facilities of all Linux capabilities. Mandrake Linux, as one of Linux distribution is able to perform minimal Linux system.         RAM is a computer resource that especially used as main memory. A  part of RAM's function can be changed into disk called RAM disk. This RAM disk can be used to run the Linux system. This paper explains how the Mandrake Linux system can be run in a RAM disk. The RAM disk which is used to run Linux system is loaded at the moment of initialization of Linux system. This RAM disk is called initial RAM disk (initrd). The Linux kernel which support initrd and a boot loader are needed to develop this system. The initrd file system that content Linux root system is created in this research. This initrd file is loaded into the RAM disk  using a boot loader.        This experiment shows that the Linux system can be run in the RAM disk. The Linux system that can be run is minimal Linux system because of the RAM disk capacity limitation.",

Unpredictable weather conditions and unregulated anthropogenic activities in mangrove area could lead to high turbidity conditions and possibly affect the filtering capacity of P. erosa. A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the effects of turbidity concentration and body size on the filtration rate and pseudofaeces production of P. erosa. Filtration rates significantly increased with higher turbidity concentration up to 750 mg L-1 (P &lt; 0.05). Pseudofaeces production also increased with increasing turbidity concentration (P &lt; 0.05).  Body size did not affect the filtration and pseudofaeces production of P. erosa. Results suggest that P. erosa is resilient to highly disturbed, turbid environments and therefore could be a potential candidate species for aquaculture.",

It has two applications that can contribute to the health and well being of humanity, i.e. the elimination of foodborne pathogens microorganisms, and the preservation of foods by the destruction of pests. Effects of ionizing radiation on tempe pasta selected as samples for patient food intake through Naso Gastric Tube (NGT) has been studied. Tempe pasta was vacuum packed in a laminate pouch of po lyesteraluminum foil- linear low density polyethylene and gamma irradiated at doses of 10 kGy and 25 kGy , respectively 1 under cryogenic condition and then stored at room temperature for 6 and 12 weeks. Some quality parameters were observed. There was no significant differences between un irradiated and irradiated tempe pasta on the moisture content, pH, protein content and viscosity. Meanwhile isojlavon genestein content and antioxidant capacity showed an increase by increasing irradiation dose up to 12 weeks of storage. Malonaldehyde content in tempe pasta was accelerating by increasing the irradiation dose and extending the storage period but Peroxide value was not detected in all treated samples. The irradiated tempe pasta at certain degree of viscosity and particle size could be considered as protein base food intake for immunocompromised patients through Naso Gastric Tube (NGT).",

        "description": "Production control systems for multistage manufacturing processes can be classified into push type (MRP) and pull type (JIT) systems. MRP and JIT system has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the advantages of both systems can be exploited to achieve better performance. A relatively new research trend associated with the MRP and JIT is to explore the possibility of hybrid system and to develop model for the integrated system. So, the choice of a production philosophy by a manufacturing company is important. The key components of overall profitability are holding cost inventory, WIP, set-up time and cost for missing due date on costumer order. The optimum lot-size associated with those of the key component. This paper presents an optimal lot-size production and integrated hybrid system with movable junction point between a Push sub-system and a Pull sub-system in production line using simulation approach. Using ARENA \u00ae simulation software this model could solve the problem. The result can achieve minimum production cost with production output level for push system of 79 to 82 unit, decreasing WIP from 85.81 hour to 84.165 hour per cycle and decreasing waiting time in works station 2 to 5.",

        "description": "Direction of criminal justice in Indonesia is currently experiencing a shift from retributive to restorative-rehabilitative or daad-dader-strafrecht or model of balance of interests. This is confirmed by Laws No. 11 of 2012 on Juvenile Justice System, which states in Article 6 to Article 8 that emphasizes the concept of restorative justice through diversion. Both of these concepts allow the settlement of children out of the criminal justice. However, not all criminal offenses committed by children can be settled out of court (diversion) unless two conditions are met: imprisonment for a criminal offense under seven years and is not a repetition of criminal offenses (recidivism). The essences of restorative justice are: First, in the settlement of children, it is necessary that the offenders and their families and victims and their families can sit together to discuss the settlement of issues including reparations to victims (restitution in integrum). Second, the essence of restorative justice is to give punishment to the offenders but the punishment is didactic, in order to benefit to both of the perpetrator and the victims.  This is in line with an adagio \u201cdelinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mitius\u201d. Third, regulation of a quo using two approaches: i.e. victims and offenders mediation approaches as implemented in North America as well as approach that emphasizes restitution and reparation (court based restitutive and reparative measure), as practiced in the United Kingdom",

        "description": "Murabahah is a buying and selling contract between two parties in which the first party, the seller (bai') has an obligation to sell goods needed by customers. The second party is the buyer (musytari). This party is obliged to pay the goods purchased. In murabahah, the first party or the seller (bai') informs the customers about the cost of goods sold along with the agreed profit. Murabahah is commonly used in Islamic bank financing practices especially murabahah with buying authority. In this practice, akad (contract) murabahah and authorization contract are merged in one contract. This means that the seller will automatically become the party who gives authorization and the buyer becomes the party who receives authorization. The problem of the research is how the murabahah contract with buying authority is applied in Islamic bank financing which accords with Islamic principles. The type of the research is juridical normative by using legal approach. This research used primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials as the main source. The analysis method used was descriptive method. The research result indicates that the merging of both murabahah contract and buying authority contract are approved to be correct according to Islamic principles. However, it must be conducted carefully since there has to be clear differentiator between when the murabahah contract and when authorization contract take place. Other than that, there has to be clear from several parties between the rights and obligations of the parties involved in murabahah contract and buying authority. In the financing practice with buying authority, banks are the seller when murabahah contract takes place and customers are the buyers. Meanwhile, in buying authority contract, banks are the principals and customers are the agents. Murabahah contract is conducted after buying authority contract takes place.",

One of the causes of the less optimal quality of the decision to test regulations under the law was the absence of procedural law for the testing of material test rights that can accommodate the needs of the proceedings. These article wishes to propose a number of ideas so that in the future the MA will begin to discuss the procedural law for the testing of laws and regulations under the Act through trials that were open to the public. This is based on the principle that disputes in the laws and regulations under the Act not only examine juridical aspects, but also facts, and the decisions are final and binding, so that they have a broad impact on the public. Therefore, it is necessary to develop material on the contents of the procedural law for the testing of laws and regulations under a law that reflects the principle of fairness in order to increase public trust.",

The hoax issues were made into a spear to 'legalize' the da'wah which he regarded as a very noble teaching. Because the meaning of such da'wah, as a result Islam is often blamed as a religion of terrorism. In the other, there is also a group of people who are afraid of Islam (Islamophobia). This is where the need to reconstruct da'wah models that seem radical. KH. Said Aqil Siroj, a national religious figure who now occupies the chair position of the Chairman of PBNU, has a distinctive model and movement of da'wah as actualized by Wali Songo when spreading Islam. The re-actualization of Wali Songo's teachings is echoed by KH. Said Aqil Siroj through persuasive approach, not force, keep the traditions, persistence of da'wah and reconstruct the meaning of Ahlussunah Wal Jama'ah as social values. Such a form of dakwah proved to have a devastating effect on the growth of Islamic values rahmatal lil 'alamin.",

The disease is caused by bacterial infection and induced by drastic changes of water quality. Lysozyme has the ability to break down bacterial cell wall. The purpose of this research was to construct of a binary vector pMSH1-Lys carrying chicken Lysozyme (Lis) gene and introduce pMSH1-Lis on K. alvarezii. The binary vector expression was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 by triparental mating. Thallus was inoculated with A. tumefaciens carrying pMSH1-Lis and then the transformed thallus was selected by adding 20 mg/L hygromycin to the culture medium. PCR analysis showed that the construction of the binary plasmid pMSH1-Lys was established. Percentage of transformation of pMSH1-Lis on K. alvarezii was 23.56%, while the efficiency of regeneration was 11.32%. PCR analysis showed that three of the regenerated thallus contained Lysozyme gene. Thus, transgenic K. alvarezii was produced successfully and this can be useful for studying the mechanisms of seaweed defense against bacterial infection.",

This research was aimed to isolate and identify A. flavus from peanut and its processed products collected from some traditional markets in Bogor, Depok and Jakarta, and detection of their aflatoxin genes. Fungal isolation was using AFPA media. Fungal identification was carried out by combining morphological and molecular analysis used species specific primers FVAVIQ1/FLAQ2 and AFLA-F/AFLA-R, while detection of  aflatoxin genes employed four specific primers of apa-2 (aflR), nor-1 (aflD), ver-1 (aflM) and omt-1 (aflP). From 36 samples, the A. flavus group was only found in peanut kernels samples with viable count of specific colonies in the range of 0.01-5.52 x 10-4 cfu/g. The total 18 isolates were identified as A. flavus based on species specific primers FVAVIQ1/FLAQ2 and AFLA-F/AFLA-R by producing amplicons about 100 and 413 bp respectively. Based on aflatoxin gene analysis showed that all 18 isolates successfully amplified by both apa-2 and nor-1, 83.3 % by omt-1 and 72.2 % by ver-1 genes which taking part in aflatoxin production. The amplicons size of apa-2, nor-1, ver-1 and omt-1   primer pairs were about 1032, 400, 895 and 1024 bp respectively.",

This study aims to do inventory of exotic plant species in this area and perform invasive plant risk analysis to the exotic plants found. The invasion risk assessment of detected exotic plants analyzed using Weed Risk Assessment (WRA) method. Moreover, analysis of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on inequality performed on relative humidity, light intensity, and soil pH. There are eleven exotic plant species which consist of three tree species and eight species of herbs / shrubs. Lantana camara and Camellia sinensis are the exotic species with biggest and smallest WRA score respectively.  MDS analysis shows that exotic tree species have similar environmental variables. Moreover, environmental variables of Clidemia hirta are relatively different from other exotic species found in the Halimun Salak corridor.Recommendations for the management of invasive exotic plant species in the area are:  immediate management implementation, priority of eradication to exotics that have not been abundant but have a high risk score, two management options (gradual eradication or containment) should be considered for exotics with very high WRA score such as Ageratina riparina, Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara.",

A total of 28 samples including 16 ITS sequences from GeneBank were used. Species of Ensete and Musella were incorporated as an outgroup. Total DNA was extracted by the modified CTAB. ITS-5 and ITS-4 primers were used to amplify the ITS regions. Data sequences were edited by ChromasPro and were aligned by Muscle software.Some unique nucleotides were found in M. balbisiana, M. itinerans, and M. textilis sequences. Strict consensus tree revealed from Maximum Parsimony (MP) as well as Bayesian analysis showed Musa textilis was separated from other taxa in which M. textilis become as the basal sister to M. balbisiana. By using MP analysis, M. itinerans together with M. acuminata ssp. banksii, M. acuminata var. tomentosa, and M. celebica placed in the same clade, whereas Bayesian analysis showed M. itinerans was separated and placed in different clade.",

Using data from 714 respondents/students with various backgrounds, the research unveils that in general, Internet adoption among female users are lower than that among male users.  Using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the research also finds that the Internet adoption among female users is affected by perceived ease of use rather than perceived usefulness. On the other hand, the Internet adoption among male users is affected by perceived usefulness rather than perceived ease of use. Male users are found to have a more flexible Internet access venue when compared to female users. The research also gives an evident that Internet USAge pattern among male and female users differs. Proportion of female users who use the Internet for chatting and study-related activities is significantly larger than that of male users. Conversely, proportion of male users who use the Internet for reading online news, testing and downloading software, shopping, entertainment, seeking job vacancy, and visiting pornographic sites are larger than female users. High cost Internet access and low access speed of the Internet and a lack of English proficiency are identified to be most severe obstacles of the Internet adoption in Indonesia.",

        "description": "The Article 12 Paragraph (1) of The Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 31 of 2004 on Fisheries states that any person is prohibited from doing acts that lead to pollution and / or damage fish resources and / or the environment in fisheries management area of the Republic of Indonesia. According to the provision, the fishery resource must be protected. However, the protection given has not run properly. This study aims at explaining about the protection of marine fisheries resources in the Aceh region, the impacts of illegal fishing and the efforts to solve the problems. Library and field research was done to obtain the data of this research. The results showed that the protection done by Aceh Government is based on national regulations and local rules although there are no specific rules, the government authority of Aceh is only 12 nautical miles, the use of Rumpon and Langge can trigger conflict between fishermen, the destruction of small fish dead, and the use of trawl. The consequences are the destruction of coral reefs, the potential conflicts between fishermen, the destruction of small fish, the depletion of fish biodiversity, and the declining income of fishermen. The efforts taken are to prioritize the regulation of fisheries issues comprehensively and improve the supervision. It is recommended that local governments make special regulations in order to protect fish resources, fishermen, and enhance better coordination.Keywords: Protection, Fishery, Local government",

        "description": "Background Dipterocarpus littoralis Blume is a critically endangered dipterocarp species found only on Nusakambangan Island, Central Java, Indonesia. Patterns of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of adults and saplings in two extant populations (Kali Jati and Solok Besek) were estimated using ten microsatellite markers. Results A total of 39 alleles was found, with two and four alleles being unique in adult and sapling populations, respectively. Allelic richness and heterozygosity was similar between adult (Ar = 3.00; He = 0.423) and sapling (Ar = 3.25; He = 0.441) populations.Inbreeding coefficientsin saplingswere positive in both populations and statistically significant in Kali Jati, while those in adult populations were not significantly different from zero, indicating excessive inbreeding and selfing in the sapling populations. Genetic differentiation of the sapling populations (FST = 0.036) was slightly lower than in the adult populations (0.050), but only significantly so for saplings.Conclusions This study revealed that D. littoralis has low genetic diversity in both adults and saplings. Similarly low values in allele richness and heterozygosity suggest that reductions of population size have been ongoing for long periods in this species. Significant genetic differentiation between sapling populations but not adult populations indicates that recent fragmentation is further accelerating the isolation process.",

This competition was taken place on objects that have to be regulated and licensing authority. Decree of local law quash suit by the Ministry of Home Affairs is becoming legal standing debate. Decree of ministry as a central authoritative regulator extensively regulates the locally local government activity at the local area. The study also found that decision space of local government in decentralization is narrower than central government one.

        "description": "Preparations and modifications of Ni-Mo/natural zeolite and Mo-Ni/natural zeolite catalysts as well as their characterizations had been carried out. The preparations of catalysts were carried out by reacting a natural zeolite produced in Wonosari with the precursor of Ni(NO3)2.9H2O and Mo(NH4)7.6H2O. The modifications were performed by varying the rasio of Ni/Mo whereas the Mo was previously loaded to the zeolite or Mo/Ni ratio whereas the Ni was previously loaded and the total metal content was 1 wt.% based on the zeolite. The aim of this research for the fututure is to prepare catalysts with high acidity and crystallinity for the conversion of waste plastics fraction to gasoline fraction (C5-C12 hydrocarbons).    The characterization of catalysts included determination of metal content using Atomic Adsorption Analysis (AAS), acidity by adsorption of ammonia or pyridine vapour  base method, and crystallinity by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The treatment of catalysts using Etilene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid  (EDTA) was performed to study the metal distribution on the outer or inner surface of the zeolite.    The characterization results showed that the loading of Ni and Mo to the zeolite produced higher acidity catalysts than those of monometal loaded catalysts. The increase of Ni loaded caused the decrease of catalysts acidity, on the other hand, the increase of Mo loaded caused the increase of catalysts acidity. The metals loaded on the zeolite were distributed inside the pore and at outer surface of the zeolite. For all catalyst samples, the acidities determined using ammonia were higher than those of pyridine, and the acidities determined before the EDTA treatment was lower than those after the treatment.  The metals loading on the zeolite did not defect its crystallnity. Metal contents of the zeolite before the EDTA treatment were higher than those after the treatment. The relationship between the metal ratios towards the catalyst acidity was varying. The EDTA treatment to the zeolite sample enhanced the crystallinity of the sampel. Catalyst samples produced in this research have high acidities and crystallinities, thus promisingly can be used for conversion process of waste plastics to gasoline fraction.",

The background of the emergence of the concept of citizenship in the classical Islamic doctrine is influenced of a war situation, namely the global terms of conflict between Islam and non-Muslims. However, the classical scholars concept of dzimm\u012b that contain elements of discrimination is no longer can be applied because it is not in accordance with the example of the Prophet and also the concept of the modern state. So that the treatment of non-Muslim minorities must be returned by the example of the Prophet as set forth in the Charter of Medina, whose contents are still relevant to modern context for it contains universal human values.DOI: 10.15408/ref.v13i3.904",

        "description": "Atomization is the most common method for producing powders from metal. There are three atomization methods in powder fabrication : water atomization, gas atomization, and centrifugal atomization. Atomization was being developed to increase powder quality and process productivity. A new atomization method is possible to find by using another energy resources. Oxy-acetylene can be used as an energy resource in atomization. In this research, powders are made by oxy-acetylene atomization method. Material in wire form is melted in oxy-acetylene flame, which has operating temperature around 3480oC, and atomized to form a fine spray. The fine molten droplets rapidly solidify forming a powders. This research investigate the variation of wire diameter and flame gun attacking angle on atomization process efficiency and production rate. Wire material which used in this research is commercial steel wire with 0.75 mm; 1.25 mm; 1.50 mm in diameter. Flame gun attacking angle is varied 25o, 30o, 35o, 40o, and 45o.Result shows that oxy-acetylene atomization method can be used to produce metal powders. The characteristic of powders which produced by this&nbsp; atomization method have spherical shape, 75 \uf06dm &ndash; 90 \uf06dm in size, oxidized, and carburized. The efficiency and production rate of the atomization process are around 12.2% and 0.1429 gram/minute. This efficiency and production rate are influenced by wire diameter. Bigger wire diameter results higher efficiency, but lower production rate. For 1.25 mm diameter of commercial wire steel, an optimum efficiency of atomization process, 15.1%,&nbsp; are resulted by 30o of flame gun attacking angle.",

Rare earth minerals or rare earth elements is one of the unrenewable natural resources and became important components for high-tech products in 21st century\u0080\u0099s life. China became a leader in rare earth industry and has control over 90 percent of global\u0080\u0099s rare earths supply and production. However, Chinese Government start to restrict rare earths export and use this leverage as a economic instrument that affects the importer countries that depends on its supply, such as United States. The reasons behind export restriction was based on environmental problems, to fullfil increasing domestic demands and to sustain it\u0080\u0099s unrenewable resources. The sources that is used on this research are obtained trought the books, journals, reports, documents, websites, online media, and also earlier related researches. This research use nation-state as the analysis level with international political economy, national interest and rational model concepts. This research is intended to assessing China\u0080\u0099s rare earths policy implications to the United States\u0080\u0099 high-tech products, economic, political, and national security situations. As the implications of this policy, United States worries about its domestic rare earth shortages could affect its national interest and sued Chinese Government to World Trade Organization due to unfair China\u0080\u0099s export restriction and monopoly.Keywords : Rare Earths, Export Restriction Policy, China, United States, International Political Economy",

        "description": "Islam as a religion of dakwah. In the call for God's pathway, one not only needs strategies  but also knowledge as a long process that must be followed. Various ways are followed with full of wisdom, gentleness, and consistence (bil himah wa mauizhotil hasanah). A strategy and media are required  to maintain the holiness of the message that bless the whole world and its nature (rahmatan lilalamin), in order that message is received wholly (kaffah), impartially, to give effect to attitude and behavior of Islamic communities. As a religion of dakwah, Islam is easily penetrated and accepted by various peoples, when it is inclusive, open to social cultural and social political. Due to the openness social cultural value and the holy message merge without significant obstacles or friction.The two way attention and movement of dakwah actually enable Islam inscribe golden lines along human civilisation and spread through different continents and countries including Indonesia. This is because the message of Islam contains piety which transcendental, and scaral as well as  humanism which profane and worldly in the society. The transformation of sacred values has inhuman spirit that can go beyond human barrier and partition and make the person full of faith and beliefs. Moreover, dakwah shows historical social reality. The massive sympathy people show to the transformation of the value often produce ideas and movement supported by the transcendental power.Keywords: dakwah, inclusive, transformation Islam adalah agama dakwah. Seruan atau ajakan kepada \u201cjalan Tuhan\u201d (sabili rabb) menempuhnya tidak hanya membutuhkan strategi tapi juga ilmu sebagai bagian dari proses panjang yang mesti harus dilalui. Beragam jalan ditempuh, tentunya dengan kearifan, penuh bijaksana lemah-lembut dan teguh pendirian (bil hikmah wal mauizhotil hasanah). Kesucian pesan yang mengandung rahmat bagi seluruh alam dan segala isinya (Rahmatan lil \u2018taalamin) agar senantiasa terjaga dan tertransformasikan baik secara langsung atau tidak langsung pada ummat dibutuhkan strategi dan media. Hal ini agar \u201cpesan suci\u201d tersebut diterima secara utuh (kaaffah), tidak potong-sepotong karena akan berdampak pada sikap dan perilaku ummat. Sebagai agama dakwah, Islam lebih mudah masuk di semua kalangan dan diterima ketika bersifat inklusif, senantiasa membuka diri, dalam ruang dialektika sosial budaya, bahkan sosial politik. Berangkat dari keterbukaan inilah sehingga antara nilai sosial budaya di satu tempat dan \u201cpesan suci\u201d yang menjadi misi dakwah menemukan titik temu, tanpa ada gesekan dan benturan yang signifikan.",

        "description": "Law enforcement process relying on legal assurance then narrowed down to regulation assurance will result in the destruction on the justice in society. In fact, the application of law, in its process, vows to be based on the maxim of \u2018for the divine justice'. However, since the criminal law currently applied is still the colonial legacy with the cover and face of Indonesia, \u2018the divine justice' is still merely a slogan. The criminal law, therefore, that is expected to be the means to prevent or eradicate crimes is difficult to be applied optimally. Therefore, a breakthrough in the field of criminal law rooted from the Indonesian culture is needed. The criminal law as this renewal is expected to be able to erase the disparity in the punishment, by giving the aim of the punishment and guidance for the judge as well as to apply the modified punishment system as the characteristic of modern criminal law. Consequently, the law applied and enforced will create social justice for all Indonesian based on divine justice. This particular justice is the one that should be prioritized by the law enforcement agent and not merely a legal assurance.Keywords: Reform, justice, assurance, law, society.",

This study aims to determine the effect of interaction TKKS compost and fertilizer N, P, and K on the growth and yield of sweet corn, as well as getting the best dose. Experiments conducted at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Riau, Pekanbaru in April and July 2014. The study was conducted experiments using a factorial randomized block design (RCBD), 3 replications. Factor 1: Compost TKKS and Factor 2: Fertilizer N, P and K (Urea, SP-36 and KCl). Parameters those measured were plant height (cm), stalk diameter (mm),  tasseling time  (DAP), silking time (DAP), harvesting time (DAP), cob diameter (mm), husked cob weight / 4, 5 m2 (kg) and without husk cob weight / plot. The results showed those compost TKKS with Urea, SP-36 and KCl observations showed interaction parameter appears when the tassel and silking time, a single factor in the treatment of compost TKKS significantly different at a time parameter tasseling time and husked cob weight while single factor Urea, SP-36 and KCl had no meaning on all parameters. Fertilizer combination TKKS 4 ton / ha with urea (225 kg / ha), SP-36 (150 kg / ha) and KCl (75 kg / ha) gives a high weight of husked cobs with the acquisition of the results of 9.167 kg / 4.5 m2, equivalent to 20.373 tons / ha, compared with those without compost TKKS and without Urea, SP-36 and KCl husked cob weight gain of 7.133 kg / 4.5 m2, equivalent to 15.839 tons / ha (up 22.25%).",

        "description": "The squeezing process of grated coconut into coconut milk, and the following process of  making the milk into coconut oil, which is done by people living in rural areas, is until now still very traditional. They do it manually (by hands) so that they produce 7.2 kg/hour grated coconut or 3.6 litres/hour thick coconut milk.To effectify the process, the squeezing needs to be mechanized, using a grated coconut squeezer machine.The machine is designed on the basis of Screw Press system with a \u00bc HP 1450 rpm electric motor power using a pulley belt transmission and a gear box. The squeezer's force refers to coconuts aging between 341 and 413 days (hand squeezing force normally practised by coconut oil producers in rural areas).This prototype of machine has the capacity of producing 53.2 kg/hour grated coconut or 26.6 litres/hour thick coconut milk, which has similar quality (in colour, smell and texture) as that manually squeezed.",

The Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad never imposed anybody to become a Muslim at that time, he also allowed Christians doing their ritual activity inside the mosque. This paper also describes the context of the Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad order to burn a mosque in Mad\u012bna. This paperr ejects some views of the orientalists, like Robert Spencer who wrote a book entitled The Truth about Mu\u1e25ammad: The Founder of the Most Intolerant Religion in the World.

Integron detection indicated  that eight isolates out of nine E. coli  isolates possessed a conserved segment of the integron. Amplification of  the inserted cassette of the integron in this SG2 isolate yielded a 1-kb DNA fragment. Sequence analyses indicated that this fragment was homologous with aad gene, which confirmed  the resistance  to spectinomycin/streptomycin. This is the first report on the presence of integron in the E. coli isolated from the environment.",

        "description": "The peace accord of Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) has become an important event for the democracy implementation in Aceh by promulgation of the new Law on Governing of Aceh (LoGA or UUPA). One of the points of the MoU and UUPA was political democratization by implementing direct election (PILKADA) of the Governor, of all over Aceh province in 2006. This event is a part of democracy in Aceh and the pioneer of direct election in Indonesia which made this as the most historic one. Further more, the direct election also has given opportunity for independent candidate pairs, especially the former GAM combatant to run for election freely against political parties affiliated candidates. It was an unpredicted result, in which an independent pair has successfully won. The candidates, who were predicted to be the winner, lost from the Irwandi Yusuf and Muhammad Nazar. The success of this direct election proves that the Aceh electorates are smart for democratic system; they are able to understand the existence of democracy as a good change, either politically, economically or socially to build Aceh.Keywords: Democracy, election for local Governor.",

        "description": "Internal and international conflicts are considerably influential to the sovereignty of a state. Sovereignty is defined as an authority to manage the territory, government and political life of a state. In the execution level it is apparent that a national sovereignty does not solely belong to a state. This paper attempts to discuss the definition and function of a state's sovereignty and how the sovereignty is mantained in absolute way over other states. In addition, this paper argues the existence of International Law that is perceived to have \u201cseized out\u201d the sovereignty of a state in which case also violates the nation's sovereignty. Finally, this paper will analyze the position of sovereignty from the perspective of International law. In conclusion, this paper affirms that sovereignty of a state depends rather on how a state maintain its relation with others; and at the execution level, a state would not be able to maintain its sovereignty in absolute way, since it relates to various political interests in international setting. As a country with sovereignty, Indonesia should be able to resolve its internal conflicts through a fair play and avoid oppressive actions, particularly when it concerns with the issue of respect to the human rights.Keywords: sovereignty, Jurisdiction, residue of power",

To achieve the aims, the doctrinal and non-doctrinal researches were carried out. The secondary data were gathered through library research and documentary research in related institution. The primary data were gathered through interview with the victims and the corporate directors. The research result shows that: first, the factors influencing the law enforcement are the decree, the bureaucracy, politics, etc., which makes the law enforcement not effective. Second, in the implementation, the decree does not regulate about the legal protection for the victims, so there are many ways to give legal protection for the victims, such as; through the mediation between the victims which is mediated by the environment department, or file a civil lawsuit. In the future, the ideal concept of legal protection is that in determining the sanctions to the criminal, the responsibility of the doer to the victim should also be included, both factual and potential victims.Key words: Application Policy, Legal Protection, Victims, Environmental Crimes.",

The concern among others, looks at several things, first, changes in the terms or the negative designations such as indigenous peoples, communities and other backward into Remote Community Community or Remote Indigenous Community (KAT). According to Presidential Decree No. 111 of 1999 on the Development of Social Welfare KAT, and Kepmensos No. 06 / PEGHUK / 2002 on Remote Indigenous Community Empowerment, remote indigenous communities is a social group (culture) is local and dispersed and less or not participate in the network and good service social, economic, political. Secondly, the recognition of the government in the form of recognition of the existence of remote indigenous communities, recognition of social and economic rights of remote indigenous communities, recognition of traditions and customs protection of remote indigenous communities and recognition of remote indigenous community empowerment program through national and regional laws that protect the rights of communities remote indigenous as well as the states obligation to recognize and protect the rights of remote indigenous communities. This study used a qualitative descriptive qualitative research to try to explore and break through the symptoms to interpret the problems or a combination of the various problems as presented situation. This study has a Social Service Bengkalis subject while the subject is Remote Indigenous Community Empowerment Program in Desa Selat Baru. The technique of collecting data through observation, literature study and interviews. The results of research in the field found that the implementation of Remote Indigenous Community Empowerment Program by the Department of Social Welfare as the responsible agency runs quite well even though there are internal and external problems that become an obstacle. The community provides a good response to the program implemented. Social Service tries hard to be able to assist and facilitate Indigenous in order to continue to grow and decent living. But it turned out to have some constraints that hinder the passage of the program. These factors include limited funding, lack of awareness of the individuals themselves, the lack of knowledge of indigenous peoples and various other problems.

Data collection is done by qualitative method that is with approach of history of philosophy of science with Islamic perspective. Data analysis is done qualitatively by connecting each aspect covering the rationale, the similarity of language, the concepts used, the influence of other figures, the year of glory and the study of other literature. From all the process of analysis that has been done and the discussion that has been exposed it can be concluded that Sir Isaac newton in the thought of the law of gravity has been influenced by al-khazini. These findings can be taught in Madrasahs through lecture, demonstration and other methods that are sociologically anthropologically close to madrasah culture.",

This step was taken at the urging of the existing women's organizations, and then the International community made efforts to reform family law since the 1970s, known as the UN women's convention. So human equality is seen as essential for justice, but this leaves plenty of room for different views on the fairest way to accommodate differences. However, family law reform efforts, especially in Indonesia continue to roll from 1974 until now.",

The treatments were two different of treatments cut vertical slices (cut fiber),horizontal (unidirectional fibers) and cut with three thicknesses (0.3 cm, 0.6 cm, and 0.9 cm). The measuredparameter were water content, angle of repose, fineness modulus, uniformity index, grain yield, bulk density, andthe flour color. The water content obtained wasn't reached the Indonesia Standard Nasional which is still below12%, while the angle of repose has been good angle with the value 31\u00b0-41\u00b0. The fineness modulus as much as4.02% - 4.66%. Uniformity index grains with rough category has the highest amount than with the percentageof medium and smooth category, and the medium category on average direction of a cut fiber have percentagegreater than the unidirectional fiber although the difference is only a little. The percentage is still low grain yield<50%. Bulk density values obtained in this research ranged between 354.89 - 386.90 kg / m 3 . The resulting colorwasn't much different and still in the desired category was yellow-orange. Different parameters affect the slicethickness uniformity index and grain yield of turmeric. The thicker slices of turmeric, then the index uniformityand yield of turmeric powder granules produced higher. Different directions slices and slice thickness differencedoes not affect the water content, angle of repose, fineness modulus, bulk density, and color of turmeric powder.",

As lawar (Balinese food) is a favorite of locals and tourists, there needs to be anexamination into the presence of pathogenic strains of E. coli in lawar and its relation to hygiene and sanitationstandards at food stalls in Kuta.Methods: Cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 43 stalls that selling white lawar in North Kuta, Kuta andSouth Kuta. Observations and interviews to sellers were conducted to assess the personal hygiene practices,equipment/stall sanitation and sanitary facilities. Lawar samples were tested in the laboratory. Indicators of the foodquality was the number of bacterial colonies with Total Plate Count (TPC), the presence of E. coli with fertilizationtechniques and the detection of E. coli virulence genes by PCR. Data were analyzed using univariate, bivariate andmultivariate analysis.Results: As many as 44.2% of lawars contained bacterial colony &gt; 106 CFU/g; 46.5% of lawars positively contained E.coli, and 20% of those positive E. coli had the similar size band of Shiga Like Toxin Type I (SLT-I). The sellers with poorhygiene had higher risks of the presence of E. coli in the lawar compared with those having higher hygiene standards(adjusted OR=7.29; 95% CI 1.473-36.088).Conclusion: Lawar quality in Kuta was poor, as were hygiene practices and seller/stall sanitation.\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "Black rice (Oryza sativa L. \u201cCempo Ireng\u201d) is one of local rice varieties in Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta. The black color is caused by high anthocyanin content which is important source of antioxidant. The cultivation of black rice is still limited due to its tall phenotype, long vegetative stage and low productivitycompared to white rice. Paclobutrazol is a growth retardant causing dwarfing in several crop plants and reducing lodging. Blue light can improve plant quality. This research was aimed to evaluate the effect of blue light and paclobutrazol on seed germination, vegetative growth and yield of black rice. The results showed that the average of seed germination as well as the activity of \u03b1-amylase of seeds subjected to blue light were lower compared to those subjected to sunlight; however, paclobutrazol concentrations did not affect seed germination percentage. The height of rice plants treated with paclobutrazol decreased in accordance with the increase of paclobutrazol concentration. Chlorophyll content and tiller numbers increased by paclobutrazol treatment of 12.5 ppm. Nitrate reductase activity was higher in rice seedlings subjected to blue light compared to those subjected to sunlight. Iron (Fe) content of rice plants treated with 25 or 50 ppm paclobutrazol increased compared to control. It was concluded thatpaclobutrazol applicationof 12.5 ppmalready reduced plant height. The higher concentration of paclobutrazol applied the greater reduction on plant height was observed.Blue light treatment applied during black rice seed germination slightly reduced germination percentage and \u03b1-amylase activity in the germinated seeds. However, blue light treatment combined with paclobutrazol application during black rice seed germination increased chlorophyll content, tiller numbers and Fe content in black rice grain.",

        "description": "Biodiesel is alkyl esters that are produced through alcoholysis or (transesterification) process of triglycerides with methanol or ethanol in the presence of bases.  The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the molar ratio and reaction time on the yield and quality of biodiesel from used cooking oil through transesterification process assisted ultrasonic wave at a frequency of 42 kHz.  This research was conducted using waste cooking oil obtained from the cracker factory in Sukarame, Bandar Lampung.  The chemicals used are methanol and NaOH as catalyst (both are of technical grade).The experiment was arranged by two factors, namely the molar ratio and reaction time.  Factor molar ratio of methanol the used cooking oil is composed of three levels, namely 3 : 1, 4,5 : 1, and 6 : 1.  Reaction time factor consists of three levels, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 30 minutes.  All treatments are carried out with three replications.  The results showed that the presence of ultrasonic wave can eliminate the process of heating and stirring at conventional biodiesel transesterification process.  Production of biodiesel produced in this reaction ranged from 55,67 to 70,67 % with the characteristics density of 0,86 to 0,94 kg/liter, acid number 0,09 to 0,15 %, and viscosity of 4,16 to 8,07 cSt.  Statistically, molar ratio and reaction time significantly affect the yield and acid number of biodiesel but did not significantly affected the viscosity and density of biodiesel.  Molar ratio and reaction time best obtained at a molar ratio of 6 : 1 with reaction time of 30 minutes.  Biodiesel produced could potentially be used as a substitute fuelin kerosene stove.",

        "description": "Saline soil is a common problem in coastal paddy field, especially in Indonesia. Salinity affects rice growth and the activities of soil functional microbes, including functional bacteria, which play roles in plant growth. Some of these microbes are associated with rice plants and are able to survive under saline condition. The presence of functional microbes is also important to improve soil quality. Nitrogen and phosphate are essential soil nutrients and is available in soil due to the activities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and free-living plant-associated bacteria.  The objective of the present study was to obtain nitrogen-fixing, phosphate solubilizing and Indole Acetic Acid  (IAA)-producing bacteria that are able to survive and promote the growth of rice under saline conditions. From rice and peanut rhizosphere, Ca-phosphate (Ca-P) solubilizing and nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated separately using specific media. Then, the Ca-P solubilizing ability, phosphomonoesterase activity and IAA-producing ability were quantitatively examined. Based on the abilities, 20 strains were selected and identified as Burkholderia cepacia-complex, Burkholderia anthina, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Bacillus cereus-complex (three strains), Achromobacter spanius, Azospirillum sp. (four strains), Azotobacter sp. (three strains), Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium sp. (two strains), and Pseudomonas sp. (three strains). The inoculation of several single strains or the mixture of the selected strains promoted the growth of rice under saline conditions. These inoculants could be potential as biofertilizer in saline paddy fields.",

So that it is needed to make a tool that enhances efficiency and quality of bamboo strip as raw material to produce bamboo-made handicrafts. This study aimed to make a tool that enhances efficiency and quality of bamboo strip as raw material to produce bamboo-made handicrafts.The steps are as follows one bar of bamboo was cutted with 0.5 m length and 0,15 width. Then, the outer skin was peeled before it was sliced into some strips. Next, the strips of bamboo was feeded to a channel and booster unit in a spinned condition. Each tests were repeated 3 times i.e. 5 samples in wet condition and 5 samples in dry condition. Part of tested bamboo was classified into 3 types i.e. culm, middle and end. Then,  percentage of rodent bamboo, and the period of split process.The performance test of splitter bamboo tool for wet bamboo found that the percentage of bamboo culm is 33,33 %, middle 20 % and end 26,67%. Based on the percentage, Culm has bigger percentage than others due to the culm has a more suitable thickness with the knife from the splitter tool. Whereas the dry of the sample found that the percentage of culm, middle is similar about 33,33 % and the end part of the bamboo has percentage around 20 %. This condition exists since the dry sample of the bamboo has a more stabilized texture than the wet one due to still high water content.",

        "description": "Custom of wedding ceremony in Sunda ethnic has three parts: before wedding (pre-luminal), wedding procession (luminal) and after wedding (postluminal).This wedding of Sunda custom directly or indirectly has symbols and meanings which have absorbed Islamic values, which came in the fifteenth century in the Sunda Land. Hence, Sunda values and norms have completed Islamization. This Islamizaion is still going, without eliminating those values and customs which do not contravene Islamic religion.DOI: 10.15408/ref.v13i5.916",

        "description": "Traditional grain drying is a practical way of drying grain, cheap, simple and commonly used by farmers.  Grain is spread on the floor which causes grain mixed rock and dirt around the drying floor.  Disadvantages in traditional grain drying are it requires a lot of manpower to spread, to flip back and to collect the grain, and requires large floor for drying.  On the other hand, grain drying using mechanical rack has the advantage that it avoids some of the grain that is not mixed with rock and dirt while drying, shorten the drying time, and easily move the grain when it rains. The purpose of this study was to test the performance of mechanical dryer.  The experiments were set up with drying treatment at 80 cm above the surface of the cement floor, on top of grassy land surface, and on the surface of rocky land with 4 cm thick of sample. The parameters measured in this study were consisted of drying time, moisture content, drying rate, energy of radiation received, the energy to evaporate the water and heats of the material, and drying efficiency. The results of research on the treatment of three environmental conditions indicated that. The average water content was 13.90% wb, 13.82% wb, and 13.98% wb respectively for the surface of the cement floor, on top of grassy land surface, and on the surface of rocky land. The average drying rates in this study were 0.494% /h for the surface of cement floor, 0.487% /h for on top of grassy land surface, and 0.534% /h for on the surface of rocky land.  Drying time in this study were 10 - 11 hours with an average radiation energy received on this experiment at 614.42 Watt/m2. Drying efficiency of each treatment were 12.58%, 12.43%, and 13.72% respectively for the surface of the cement floor, on top of grassy land surface, and on the surface of rocky land. From the observations and calculations derived drying over the surface of cement floor, on top of grassy land surface, and on the surface of rocky land are recommended for drying using a mechanical rack dryer.",

The reaserchwas conducted infour levels smoking time,which are 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours. The analysis on smokedwhitelipped eelcatfish applied kind of proximate analysis (fat level, protein level,ash level and moisture level), microbiologyanalysis (Total Plate Count (TPC), Escherechia coli bacteria, Salmonella sp. bacteria and Staphylococcus aureusbacteria) and organoleptic analysis (appearance, odour, flavour and texture). The results of this research showthat the smoking time levels affect the quality of whitelipped eel catfish. The proximate analysis result showdifferences among the treatments especially on the proximate analysis. Organoleptic analysis shows that onappearance parameter, only whitelipped eel catfish that are smoked for 3 hours fulfill theminimumvalue (7,0).Whereas organoleptic values for odour, flavour and texture parameter showthat onlywhitelipped eel catfish thatare smoked for 1 hour that does not fulfill theminimum value. Microbiology analysis shows that the content ofTPC and Escherechia coli bacteria smoked fish get under the maximum value of tolerance arrenged on SNI ineach treatment. The content of Salmonella sp. and Staphyococcus aureus bacteria are negative on the wholetreatments.",

It causes the fertile top soil losses which is good for plant growth.Tillage farming is particularly convinced as the prime cause on soil erosion. This research aims to determiningthe effect of tillage systemand herbicide to predict the losses of nutrients and organicmatter due to erosion. Thisexperiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Lapang Terpadu and Laboratory of Soil Science, Faculty ofAgriculture, University ofLampung inMay toAugust 2014. The experimentwas design as a factorial in completelyrandomized block design (RCBD) consisting of two factors, namely the tillage systemand herbicidewith 4 (four)repetitions. The results showed that the treatment of soil tillage, herbicides, and the combination of themdid notsignificantly affect the concentration ofN (total), K (exchangable), Ca (exchangable),Mg (exchangable), and theC (organic)matter in sediment.While theP (available), only the tillage systems that provided significant effect. Ata minimum tillage system P (available) concentration was significantly higher than the conventional tillagesystem. This was due to the nature of the immobil phosphorus, itmean the phosphorus in the soil remains in thetop soil otherwisemechanically inserted into the sub soil. The limited tillage onminimumtillage systems causesphosphorus remain inthe top soil, so thatwhen erosion occurs phosphorus losses inminimumtillage system willbe higher thanin conventional tillage. The conventional tillage systemcauses loss of P (available) of 0,016 kg/haand the minimumtillage systemcauses loss of P (available) of 0,01 kg/ha.",

Rattan  bark  fiber containing about 40% cellulose, which was potential to be used as filler for composite applications.  Nanotechnology  based  nanoparticles  with  High  Energy  Milling  (HEM) has been applied in this research to find the optimum particle size to be implemented as automotive component filler. Three HEM has been applied (1 hour, 5 hours, and 10 hours), and without HEM (0 hours) as control. Measurable particle size is the size of the single particle. Data in the form of  particle size distributions, intensity, number and volume of distribution, so it can  be assumed to describe the overall condition of the sample. The result shows that 5 hours milling produce the smallest particle size (16.22 nm) and  z averages (129.78 nm). Particle Size Analy zer (PSA) results was related to the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of 5 hour milling, particle become smaller and look the same or homogeneous as balls. These results  indicate that the cellulose in the form of three-dimensional nanoparticles is spherical, and the mechanical tests show that biocomposite rattan bark fiber performance was highest among  the  other  natural  composites  (kenaf,  acacia,  water  hyacinth,  banana, coconut).",

If all this gossip to talk bad about as far as is known, then the Foster (2004) explains that one function of gossip is to influence people. One form that seems extreme is social control. The existence of social control are expected to achieve harmony in social life.In the current study focused on adolescents. In the adolescent phase of this development has wider social life and diverse. Patterns of friendship that extends also part of one's youth. Another important point is very sensitive to adolescents evaluative information against him. Thus gossip as a tool for social control could be the entrance to evaluate the adolescents in their everyday lives. R e s e a r c h e r s t a k e a s a m p l e o f approximately 250 adolescents randomly sampling with this type of random sampling. The proportion of men and women equally, the median age was 18.58 years (SD = 1.79). In this study used self-report measure of modality. Subtest function measurement using gossip as a tool to influence others from scale measuring GFQ (questionnaire Gossip Foster), composed by Eric foster (2004). As a result, 55.2 per cent of participants of the important functions of gossip influence others. However, if both sexes were compared results were not found substantial differences (though the average higher for women). Using these results can be expected that most gossip, but does not control or at least influence other people. It could, the supervisory functions should be something concrete, not just talk about word of mouth.",

        "description": "Disturbances caused by the conversion of rain forests into agricultural systems provide an opportunity for the expansion of Invasive Plant Species (IPS). Bukit Duabelas National Park is one of the few remaining lowland forests in Jambi Province (Sumatera, Indonesia). The surrounding areas up to the national park borders have already been converted into jungle rubber agroforests as well as rubber and oil palm plantations which might lead to an increased spread of IPS into the forest. This study was aimed at compiling a list of IPS and determining their distribution and coverage of IPS in four land use systems (rain forest jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm plantations). Spatial distribution patterns were investigated by creating a horizontal vegetation profile diagram for the permanent plots of the EFForTS project (Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems, http://www.uni-goettingen.de/crc990). The dominance of IPS was determined using Important Value Index. A total of forty IPS were identified across the four land-use systems. The numbers of IPS were the highest in oil palm (28 species) and rubber plantations (27 species), and the lowest in jungle rubber (10 species). IPS were absent in the lowland rain forest. The diversity of IPS was influenced by environmental factors, especially canopy openness. IPS with the highest ground coverage were Dicranopteris linearis and Clidemia hirta. Both of them were found in all three land-use systems outside the rain forest when the forest canopy opens due to illegal logging or other human disturbances. Therefore, reforestation of disturbed areas is recommended to prevent the spread of IPS.",

Surpluswater (runoff) in raining season is captured and collected inthe pond, and used for irrigation in the following cultivation. The objective of this researchwas to determine theoptimumratio of the landto pond area. This researchwas carriedout in the IntegratedField Laboratory, Facultyof Agriculture, University of Lampung by using data of soil physical properties (water content, field capacity,permanentwilting point, percolation); rice crop coefficient, soybean crop coefficient and climatological data for13 years from1999 to 2011. Datawas processed using asimulation program(Visual Simulation)presented inthegraphical form. The results showed that the rainwater potential that can be utilized as an alternative irrigationis abundant, about 1500 mm/year - 3000 mm/year with a total of rainwater reaching 314.509,78 m3 over 13years. Based on the simulation, the most effective period of planting, for rice is in January and for soybean is inMay. In addition, the optimum pond dimension to serve 1 ha cropping land is about 2450 m2 in with 3m depth,or the ratio of land to pond is 4:1.",

The statistical and histogram based time domain analysis method are the two simplest analysis method of heart rate variation. The statistical analysis consists of two steps, i.e. the average and standard deviation of normal heart rate direct measurement.

Reflectance spectra of optics signal on black mulberry and strawberry fruit have been studied for nondestructive estimation of anthocyanin pigment content. In addition, the absorbance spectra were also studied in fruit extracts with different solvent types, ie: a combined solution of tartaric acid  and ethanol  -  chloric acid.  The results showed that there is energy absorption for  chlorophyll a in the blue area, i.e.: 465 nm-  black mulberry  and  478  nm-strawberry.  While  the  energy  absorption  for  chlorophyll  b occurs in the red region with a wavelength of 650 nm  (black mulberry) and 655 nm (strawberry). Maximum peak absorbance of anthocyanin pigments of black mulberry fruit with tartaric acid solvent had occurred at 515 nm. While  for the solvent ethanol  -hydrochloric acid has occurred at a wavelength of 519 nm.",

Kautsar concludes that the work tends to be a competition in between the Abrahamic religions. However, the match was a friendly match. Dirks' book, even though apologetic and polemical in character, is served in polite way and style, and is a work trying to reconcile between the children of Abraham",

As a result, noisy image may be obtainedwhich is difficult to be recognized, processed, and analysed. The most occurred noise is salt and pepper which appears as white and black spots in image. This noise is usually removed or suppressed using median filter. However, improper size of median filter kernel may yield in poor result. This work aims to find the most suitable median filter kernel size combination using Breadth search, Depth Searchand Generate and Testmethods in order to obtain the best median filtering result. In this work, four median filter kernel sizes are used, i.e. 3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, 7\u00d77, and 9\u00d79. Filtering performance using each obtained combination is defined by measuring the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the filtered and unnoisy image (ground truth). Result shows that the best median filter kernel size combination is {3\u00d73}. This combination is obtained using Breadth Search Method with the MSE of 27.0308.",

The research used five treatments: sunlighting as a control (P0), and artificial lighting of 36-watt LED combined with 42-watt fluorescent lamps. Sunlighting represented a conventional cultivation, with normal lighting period (\u00b112 hours per day), while theartificial lighting consisted of four different lighting lengths per day: 8 hours (P1), 12 hours (P2), 16 hours (P3)and 20 hours (P4). The artificial lighting experiments were placed in boxes as the growth chambers, while theregular sunlighting treatmentwas placed inan outdoorminigreenhouse. Each treatment consisted of four plants,so there were 20 plants in total. The results showed that 20-hour treatment of 36-watt LED lamp plus 42-wattfluorescent lighting (P4) was the best among the other artificial lighting treatments, but still less optimal ascompared to the treatment of natural sun lighting (P0). The plants grew in treatmentP4 still showed etiolating,indicating possibility of using higher power than 36-watt LED lamp and 42-watt fluorescent, although the lengthof lighting reached 20 hours. Yet, in termof quality, the mineral/ash content of all treated plants was notmuchdifferent.",

People use violence as an expression of their dissatisfaction with the state justice system.

One hundred four tiger beetles belonging to twelve species and seven genera were recorded. An astonishing (100%) endemicity was observed identified to subspecies level. Thopeutica and Calomera species, specifically Thopeutica anichtchenkoi Wiesner, 2015 and Calomera mindaoensis Cassola, 2000 were observed to be abundant in the samples mostly found in the mountainous and forested open riparian ecosystem of Cagan, New Bataan. Cylindera (Ifasina) discreta elaphroides (Dokhtouroff 1882) was the most common species and was found in different habitat types, but the majority of the species showed a narrow and specialized habitat preference. Protection and conservation of remaining forest areas in Cagan is especially important in preserving endemic species.",

Bukittinggi City Tourism Development is an area of the city and one of the main tourist destination in West Sumatra with the introduction of Bukittinggi as a \"City Tour\" starting since March 11, 1984. Field of tourism in the regions designated as potential Bukittinggi based on natural and geographical conditions of Bukittinggi, its strategic position is a triangle crossing to the north, east and south of Sumatra that eases access tourists or people who want to visit a small city with myriads of this story. Besides having the natural beauty of the city of Bukittinggi is also a struggle that many stores the value of history and cultures in it.Under these conditions, formulated the problem of how the development of tourism in the city of Bukittinggi and the factors that influence the development of tourism in the city of Bukittinggi. This study uses the theory Elittan to determine strategies used in the development of tourism in the city of Bukittinggi, qualitative research with descriptive method. Researchers are trying to reveal the facts in accordance with the reality. This study did not look for or explain ties, not test hypotheses or make predictions. Data will be explained with apaa danya to obtain an understanding. From the results of this study concluded that the strategy of development of tourism in the city of Bukittinggi to involve the whole among the noble of the Stakeholde, community stempat and the nomads with the concept of Tourism-based community that creates a sense of tourism awareness and stepping to the strategy undertaken in the development of tourism can run well , but still a bit constrained in the implementation on the ground in the form of regional financial, qualified human resources, limited investment in tourism, the lack of development of tourism products as well as coordination across sectors that have not been together but slowly but surely constraints faced in the development of tourism in the city of Bukittinggi will be minimized so that tourism in the town Bukttinggi can provide maximum service and bestKey word : Strategy ,Turism Development, Tour City",

It produces a fragrant resin when subjected to fungal attack and has been traded Internationally  known  as  gaharu. Knowledge  of   genetic  diversity  and  relationship  among species and genus is important for breeding purposes and species conservation. In this study,    genetic variability of  six Aquilaria species were analyzed using the AmplifiedFragment Length  Polymorphism  (AFLP)  markers.  Ten  AFLP  primer combinations  amplified  1353  DNA  fragments ranging  in size from100 to 350 bp of  which 1285 (95%) of  them were polymorphic. Genetic similarities among Aquilaria sp. consisted of  A. malaccensis, A. beccariana, A. microcarpa, and A.  crassna  ranged  from 63.90  to 72.00 % based on Dice coefficient. The dendrogram  derived by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean of  germplasm analysis were clustered into two main groups. Hence, a genetic variation among species is quiet high.    Bootstrap  values for  the  groups  supported  70%  of   the  cluster  using  a linear  relationship  equation of  (r = 0.724, P < 0.0001) was observedbetween known pedigrees and AFLP-derived  genetic similarity for 136 pairwise comparisons of  Aquilaria species. For example, A. malacensis and A. microcarpa have the highest genetic similarity (72.00%) compared with another Aquilaria species. Primer pairs E-ACG/M-CTA produced a specific fragment for A. beccariana (850 bp), A.  crasna (550 bp, 180 bp, and 140 bp), A. malaccencis (1500 bp), A. microcarpa (250 bp) and Gyrinops versteegii (150 bp). Primer pairs E-ACG/M-CAA produced a specific DNA fragment only for A. beccariana (1500 bp and 100 bp).  Primer pairs E-ACC/M-CAC also produced only  specific fragment for A. crassna (1500 bp). Study showed the usefulness of  AFLP analysis in  Aquilaria  sp.  and  its  potential  application  for  breeding and  species  conservation.  Further, molecular  diversity  estimated  in  the  present  study  combined  with  the  datasets  on  other morphological/agronomic  traits will be useful  for  selecting  the appropriate accessions  for plant improvement  through conventional and molecular breeding approaches.",

Research on metacognition and ToM showed that the research data provided some evidence that early competence of ToM can be considered as the precursor of metamemori and the acquisition of representations of the concept is probably something crucial in the development of children, which in turn enables them to think about their memory and others.",

        "description": "This paper discusses the term \u2018kodrat perempuan' as a cultural value as well as a category of analysis. As a cultural value, kodrat perempuan reflects ideal measurement and standard of woman's role. Meanwhile, as a category of analysis, it used to explain social realities where domestication and discrimination and their implications towards woman's role can be elucidated. The source of discourse including religious discursive source plays an important role in constructing the meanings of kodrat either as a cultural value or as a category of analysis.",

This means local and national identities will be degraded by globalisation processes and replaced by global identity which contains transnational ideas. They consists of views, ideas, suggestions, topics, concepts, and values which are contracted on the basis of new paradigms, dogmas, doctrines for a global community that has no identity, open, and freeto take choices. This community focusses on attitudes that put forward to respect values and idolised money as the center of life dinamies.NU with its archipelagoic Islam tries to protect Islamic communities (ummah) from the globalisation bombardment. NU realizes the extent of responsibility to preserve and mantain the continuity of national culture as heritage from the thread of globalisation. This article aims to discuss the archipelagoc islam which becomes NU's ultimate weapon in the cultural strategy.",

The jurists agree that ashabul Furud is prioritized in taking inheritance, if there is a remnant, it is given for heirs of asabah. The jurists also agree that if someone dies and has the heirs of ashabul furudh or asabah, the relatives of the zawil arham will not have right to inherit. They have differents arguments about who will has the right to inherit, if the heir does not leave ashabul furudh or ashabah relatives. The Hanafiyah School argues that the zawil arham group has the right to inherit, if the heir does not leave ashabul furudh relatives and asabah. On the other hand, the Syafi'iyah school argues that the zawil arham group does not have right to inherit, but the property should be given to the Baitul Mal. The results of the study concluded that according to the Hanafiyah School, zawil arham is more rightful to get inheritance than others, because they have a kinship relationship with the heir, and they are more prioritized than baitul mall. Otherwise, the school of Syafi'yah stated that zawil arham does not have right to inherit the property from the heir because zawil arham is not classified&nbsp; as relatives of ashabul furudh or asabah, so that the property must be handed to baitul mal. The Legal terms used by the Hanafiyah school is based on the Koran in Surah al-Anfal (75), and hadith. Meanwhile, the Shafi'iyah school is based on Surah maryam (64), and hadith.",

The meaning of freedom of religion is examined and compared in these perspectives because there is a recurrent problem regarding this human right in Indonesia which is mostly populated by Muslims. A phenomenon of aliran sesat (diverted religious organizations) emerge nowadays ripping religious harmony among people. These diverted religious organizations and their supporters claim that it is their right to do what they believe because it is protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Right and Indonesian law. However, the majority of Muslims consider them as humiliators of the religion itself, so they urge the government to stop and punish them. The government seem to be hasitated to enforce the law, thus, from one side the government is accused of not protecting and ensuring these diverted religious organizations in using their right and freedom, while from the other side it is accused of neglecting those who humiliate religion and break the others human rights without any punishment. This study finds out that the law regarding freedom of religion in Indonesia is sufficient and what is needed is just the enforcement of this law to ensure the rights of all people. To reach the goals of this study, a descriptive-analytical approach is employed.Keywords: Freedom of religion, Islam, Human Right, Indonesian Law and Aliran Sesat (Diverted Religious Organization).",

        "description": "Indonesian shipping industry was dominated by foreign carrier vessels. This was happened because of the Indonesian government maritime policies, which were started in 1980s, were not at the side of national shipping industry. In 2005, the government has intended to revitalizing shipping industry by enacted the Presidential Instructim number 5 of 2005 (Inpres 5/2005). This Article discusses the implementation of this Instruction that was launched on 28 March 2005. This Instruction consists of cabotage principle that should be imposed in Indonesia. However, there are many other considerations to be observed to the proper implementation of this principle. This Article analyzes these considerations as well as anticipatory policies should be done.      Key words: Kabotase, Inpres 5/2005, Industri Pelayaran, Maritim, Shippping Industry.",

The transesterification reaction is carried outusing coconut oil at 60 \u00b0C and 0.5 grams of NaOH catalyst. The method is a completely randomized design witha combination of two factors, namely the molar ratio and the duration of the reaction. The molar ratio consistsof four levels (1: 3, 1: 4, 1: 5 and 1: 6), while the duration of the reaction is composed of three levels (15, 30, and60 minutes). Parameter observations include yield, density, and viscosity of biodiesel produced. Each unit ofexperiment was performed using 100 ml of coconut oil and each treatment was repeated three times. Theresults showed that duration factor significantly influence the yield and viscosity of biodiesel, while the molarratio factor significantly influence the viscosity of biodiesel. Interaction of these factors, however, do not affectparameters observed. The highest yield of biodiesel (75.56%) resulted within duration of 60 minutes andthe lowest (60.27%) on within duration of 15 minutes. Biodiesel produced has a density of 0.86 to 0.87 g/ml(complies SNI), and a viscosity of between 3.40 to 4.55 cSt",

Sample concentration of 60% treatment, 15 minutes and 90% concentration, treatment time of 15 minutes is the most efficient, because it uses only the smallest specific energy is 0.15 J/mg and 0.1 J/mg, can produce high levels of dissolved P.",

Evaluation of trickle irrigation system design were conducted by two treatment, surface and sub-surface, and slope of surface land were 0%, +2% and -2%.    The results indicated that the experiment using 3 layers of PE cover was better with the highest coefficient of water distribution uniformity with the following specifications: q= 1.31/hour with 1m head operation. The uniformity of distribution in sub-unit of this design was 74.6%, the average of diameter of soil surface wetting was 34 cm, and water content ranged from 20% - 54%. The average of sub-surface soil wetting was 31 cm, with average water content ranging from 24% - 30% in 6,5 hours application of irrigation. These ranges were still between the field capacity and permanent wilting point from the soil sample in location of study.",

Recently, there are a growing phenomenon of branding within cities and/or nations. The growing competition between cities to increase the number of visitors and investors, foreign and domestics, and develop new businesses which in turn could absorb talents and manpowers was the background for the phenomenon. With the development of branding awareness, more and more cities/nations commit to a branding strategy so that they can measure the journey of their city/nation branding. This article began with a number of basic definitions about the city/nation branding concept; and then was followed by the case studies. The sources for this paper are derived from books and journals, the author's travelling experiences, and articles from the internet regarding the city branding and city tourism.",

        "description": "Corn cob is one abundant agricultural waste and potentially viable for animal feed.  Objective of this research was to test a hammer mill to crush the corn cob.  The study was made in two different rotational speeds, 800 rpm and 1400 rpm. A perforated screen (underneath the rotating hammer drum) with 1 cm hole size was used.  The test was conducted in three replications and each replication used 5 kg corn cob.  Variables observed included uniformity of grain sizes of the product and machine capacity.  The expected grain sizes ranged 3 to 7 mm.  The results showed that this machine performed better under 1400 rpm than under 800 rpm.  With 1400 rpm, the machine produced the expected grain sizes of the product about 45,57% by weight, and had a capacity about 15,62 kg/hour.",

Waste cooking oil viscosity higher than that of kerosene, this is a problem in the use of the mawar stove, since mawar stove used of oil pipeline smaller than 2.5 mm. The research was carried out by utilizing the mawar stove by using waste cooking oil fuel. The results showed that the flow rate of kerosene from 2.33 to 4.08 ml/s on stove and flow rate of waste cooking oil on the stove from 0.39 to 0.66 ml/s with a pressure stove 6-3 psia. Waste cooking oil can be used as fuel for mawar stoves with pressure more than 4 psia and fire to preheat stove for waste cooking oil is greater than with the use of kerosene fuel.",

The objective of this research was to predict the self life of packaged kemplang crackers placed in different storage conditions. Kemplang crackers were stored in a polypropylene (PP) plastic with three different thicknesses : 0,3 mm, 0,5 mm and 0,7 mm and relative humidity (RH) of about 63% and about 53%.  The packages were stored in ambient temperature.  The results showed that kemplang crackers stored at lower RH and thicker plastick have a longer self life.  The self life of kemplang cracker stored in PP plastic with thickness of 0,3 mm, 0,5 mm, and 0,7 mm and in ambient RH were 12 days, 14 days, and 33 days, respectively, while the self life of kemplang cracker storaged in PP plastic with thickness of 0,3 mm, 0,5 mm, and 0,7 mm and RH of about 53% were ranging from 185 days to more than >365 days.",
